if you re unsure about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy you re not alone even healthcare providers are exasperated about the mixed messages women receive so to be clear hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats also called vasomotor symptoms or vms according to the 2022 statement of the north american medical society nams for most women under 60 the benefits of therapy for bothersome symptoms and prevention of bone loss outweigh the risks per the society multiple updates from the u s preventive services task force uspstf however recommend against the use of hormone therapy for the prevention of heart disease diabetes and certain types of cancer these updates have exasperated menopause experts and left many women unsure about the safety of hormone therapy we asked stephanie faubion md director of the center for women s health at mayo clinic and medical director of the north american menopause society nams to dig deeper into the issue of hormone therapy and to put to bed the lingering confusion 
the conversation has been edited for clarity and length everyday health the uspstf issued recommendations against hormone therapy for chronic disease prevention nams agrees it should not be used for that purpose why are the recommendations a problem stephanie faubion why did they feel a need to come out for a fifth time and say this when no medical society recommends that they be used for that our nams position statement on hormone therapy certainly does not the task force statement dissuades people from treating symptoms related to menopause that s the problem people conflate the two also the task force has not researched or made any statements about the use of this therapy for vasomotor symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes which of course we d like to see since the evidence is strong eh tell me about that evidence sf multiple studies have shown that it hormone therapy is effective in treating hot flashes even in the women s health initiative study the popular large scale study that first reported the unwarranted risks when using hormone therapy for preventing chronic conditions such heart disease which was not designed to look at vasomotor symptoms when you look at the women in that study who are in their fifties the population we are most likely to treat for vasomotor symptoms the benefits tend to outweigh the risk for those women eh as a jama editorial notes when women unnecessarily worry about taking hormone therapy they instead turn to nonhormonal treatments like antidepressants anticonvulsants and dietary supplements but there isn t data on the long term risks of these treatments is there sf that s exactly right we have no idea what the long term effects are of using an antidepressant like an ssri selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor for symptom management but i can guarantee you there are some because no medication is without adverse effects also other drugs used such as gabapentin used to prevent seizures and relieve nerve pain can cause weight gain sometimes substantial weight gain there are even reports of women using cannabis and there s no data on safety or efficacy there but for some reason women feel more comfortable using things like that than they do hormone therapy because of publications such as the recommendations from the uspstf that make it all very confusing there s a lot of false advertising for supplements and other products that claim there are benefits when they really haven t been proven and that they re safer than fda approved hormones and that s simply not true eh so what is nams s position on hormone therapy sf there are three indications for use of menopausal hormone therapy one for vasomotor symptoms that includes hot flashes and night sweats two for genitourinary syndrome of menopause which may include vaginal dryness painful urination or painful sex third to help prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk each woman should work with her doctor to find the most effective formulation dose and route of administration for example there s some observational evidence that would suggest maybe a transdermal route of administration for example a patch or a cream is safer than an oral route all estrogens are not the same all progestogens are not the same we give them through different routes of delivery like oral or a patch or a vaginal ring and we give them in different doses so now more than ever we can start to individualize therapy for women based on their symptoms past medical history and family history and all this needs to be assessed on a regular basis i have my patients return once a year or sooner if any symptoms change or if anything s new about their personal or family history we don t just put somebody on hormone therapy and say you re on it forever we also don t recommend you stop taking them in three or five years or at a certain age it s really based on a woman s ongoing need for hormone therapy and what s new with her health some women elect to continue with hormone therapy longer perhaps because their symptoms persist and nothing else is adequate to manage them eh let s talk about hot flashes and night sweats they can be a lot more debilitating than people realize right sf women are missing work changing jobs turning down opportunities for advancement at work because of these symptoms these are not trivial they re impacting women s lives their relationships and their ability to function symptoms are often long in duration the average length of time is seven to nine years and 10 percent of women will have symptoms even longer when women have moderate to severe symptoms for this long waiting it out probably isn t a great option eh what s your overall message to women about hormone therapy for hot flashes sf if a woman is under 60 and within 10 years of experiencing menopause the benefits of hormone therapy tend to outweigh the risks the fact is that these uspstf warnings that come out sound so dire they make women believe that the benefits do not outweigh the risks for management of menopausal symptoms when they do
