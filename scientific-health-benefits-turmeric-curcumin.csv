 curcumin is a natural antioxidant that has anti inflammatory benefits as well as possible benefits related to slowing the aging process and preventing alzheimer s disease and potentially depression says liz shaw rdn the founder of shaw simple swaps unfortunately turmeric and curcumin on its own doesn t absorb well into the bloodstream and having it in curry once a month is unlikely to give you the desired anti inflammatory and antioxidant benefits says dana white rd the owner of dana white nutrition to reach the amounts of turmeric and curcumin shown to offer benefits in research studies you ll have to turn to supplements it is important to note however that the u s food and drug administration fda has no established safe or recommended daily value for curcumin or turmeric and the fda does not regulate any supplements still you may be able to reap more benefits by adding black pepper anytime you use turmeric or taking a turmeric supplement that incorporates black pepper there is a compound in black pepper called piperine that actually helps to make turmeric more bioavailable white explains bioavailability refers to the amount of a substance that s absorbed or able to be used by the body 2 for instance a past animal study found that 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight mg kg of piperine along with 2 grams per kilogram of body weight g kg of curcumin increased bioavailability by 2 000 percent 3 of course further research is needed to determine if the results would be the same in humans here we outline the many potential benefits of turmeric and curcumin 1 curcumin is an anti inflammatoryone of turmeric s main claims to fame is that it s commonly used to fight inflammation and the bulk of turmeric s inflammation fighting powers can be assigned to curcumin in fact in the right dose curcumin may be a more effective anti inflammatory treatment than common inflammation fighting medications such as ibuprofen advil and aspirin 4 more research is needed in this area as well because chronic inflammation contributes to many chronic diseases curcumin may help treat conditions like inflammatory bowel disease pancreatitis and arthritis 5 we ll get into some of those specific benefits later 1 
2 curcumin may help protect against heart disease a study shows that curcumin may improve endothelial function or the health of the thin membrane that covers the inside of the heart and blood vessels this membrane plays a key role in regulating blood pressure 6 lower endothelial function is associated with aging and an increased risk of heart disease thus curcumin may help protect against age related loss of function and reduce your likelihood of developing heart disease in one study researchers compared the effects of an eight week aerobic exercise program and a curcumin supplement in improving endothelial function in post menopausal women both the exercise and the curcumin group saw equal improvements in endothelial function whereas the control group saw no changes 7 another study 8 found that curcumin was equally effective at improving endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes heart disease is a common comorbidity of type 2 as the drug atorvastatin lipitor 9 a medication commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke 10 still more research is needed to determine if curcumin is a safe and effective long term treatment strategy for people with heart disease 3 curcumin may help prevent and possibly treat certain types of cancer as inflammation is linked to tumor growth anti inflammatory compounds such as curcumin may play a role in the treatment and prevention of a variety of cancer types including colorectal pancreatic prostate breast and gastric cancers 1 research in mice suggests that curcumin may help slow the spread of tumor cells and may even prevent tumors from forming in the first place 11 it may do this in several ways including disrupting the formation of cancerous cells at various stages in the cell cycle interfering with cell signaling pathways and even causing those cancerous cells to die 11 whether curcumin can help treat cancer in humans has yet to be determined but the research is ongoing some research also suggests that turmeric or curcumin can help with certain cancer symptoms one review of 11 studies on the effects of turmeric on prostate diseases including eight studies on patients with prostate cancer suggests that supplementing with turmeric or curcumin may offer perks 12 while some studies found curcumin or turmeric supplements had no effect on patients with prostate diseases a few showed beneficial effects on levels of prostate specific antigen a protein produced by the prostate gland blood levels of this protein are typically higher in men with prostate cancer urination frequency and urgency and quality of life 13 researchers note that more studies are needed to assess the true impact of curcumin on prostate conditions like cancer 12 
4 curcumin may help ease symptoms of osteoarthritisthanks to its potent anti inflammatory properties curcumin may be a safe and effective long term treatment option for people with osteoarthritis oa at least that was the conclusion of the authors of a review of the clinical use of curcumin for the treatment of osteoarthritis 14 in a past study 15 people with osteoarthritis who took 1 000 mg per day of meriva experienced significant improvements in stiffness and physical function after eight months whereas the control group saw no improvements meriva is a proprietary treatment made up of a natural curcuminoid mixture 75 percent curcumin 15 percent demethoxycurcumin and 10 percent bisdemethoxycurcumin phosphatidylcholine a chemical found in eggs soybeans and other foods 16 and microcrystalline cellulose a refined wood pulp commonly used by the pharmaceutical and food industries 17 meanwhile a recent clinical trial studied the potential effects of curcumin supplements on patients with knee osteoarthritis the group that took 40 mg of nanocurcumin in a capsule every 12 hours experienced a significant decrease in pain and stiffness after six weeks compared with the control group 18 and a study in mice found that 50 mg oral curcumin per kg of body weight significantly slowed the progression of oa whereas a topical curcumin treatment provided pain relief 19 that said whether these specific benefits apply to humans has yet to be seen 5 curcumin may help treat or prevent diabetesaccording to a past review of studies 20 curcumin may help treat and prevent diabetes as well as associated disorders like diabetic nephropathy also called diabetic kidney disease which affects people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes 21 one drawback many of the studies were done only in animals not humans for example one study found that feeding 80 mg of tetrahydrocurcumin one of the main substances in curcumin per kg of body weight to rats with type 2 diabetes for 45 days led to a significant decrease in blood sugar as well as an increase in plasma insulin 22 a study of obese mice with type 2 diabetes revealed that curcumin supplements helped lower blood insulin levels after 16 weeks 23 the authors of a recent review note that curcumin may be a good adjunct to diabetes treatment to improve insulin resistance and blood sugar control and lower blood lipids fatty substances found in the blood 24 meanwhile curcumin may help prevent diabetes through its anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties and improve many of the factors that contribute to diabetes including insulin resistance high blood sugar and hyperlipidemia a medical term to describe elevated levels of fat in the blood one type of hyperlipidemia is characterized by high levels of ldl or bad cholesterol 25 still more human studies are needed to confirm 20 
6 curcumin may help delay or reverse alzheimer s diseaseturmeric may even help protect your brain against common degenerative diseases like alzheimer s how by increasing levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf a protein found in the brain and spinal cord that plays a key role in keeping nerve cells neurons healthy as well as regulating communication between nerve cells which is critical for learning and memory 26 as common brain disorders like alzheimer s are associated with lower levels of bdnf turmeric curcumin in particular may help delay or reverse brain degeneration 27 that said much of the research has been done in rats 28 researchers note more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of turmeric in the prevention and treatment of common brain diseases 29 7 curcumin may play a role in depression treatmentlike alzheimer s depression is associated with lower levels of bdnf thanks to turmeric s ability to boost levels of bdnf the spice shows promise as an effective antidepressant in fact one study found that rats injected with 50 100 or 200 mg kg of curcumin for 10 days had a dose dependent increase in bdnf with the higher dose of 200 mg kg showing greater antidepressant effects 30 meanwhile in a study in humans researchers randomly assigned 60 patients with major depressive disorder to one of three groups one group received daily 20 mg of fluoxetine prozac is a common brand name 31 another received 1 000 mg of curcumin and a third received a combination of the two by the end of six weeks the three groups saw comparable improvements leading researchers to suggest that curcumin may be a safe and effective treatment for major depressive disorder 32 still scientists don t fully understand the role of turmeric and curcumin in treating depression and more research in humans is needed to confirm it is a safe and effective treatment you should consult your primary care practitioner before beginning or changing any medications you may be taking 33 
8 curcumin may play a role in treating rheumatoid arthritiscurcumin shows promise as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis ra a chronic inflammatory disorder that commonly affects the joints but may spread to other areas such as the eyes lungs skin heart and blood vessels 34 ra causes a painful swelling of the joints that can cause the bones to erode over time and ultimately lead to deformities and physical disabilities 34 in one study people with ra were given 500 mg of curcumin 50 mg of diclofenac sodium a prescription nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug or the two in combination 35 after eight weeks the curcumin only group saw significant improvements in joint tenderness and swelling when compared with the other two groups researchers note the curcumin treatment was also safe resulting in no harmful events 36 9 turmeric may improve skin healththanks to its anti inflammatory antimicrobial and antioxidant properties turmeric may be an effective treatment for a variety of skin conditions including acne eczema atopic dermatitis photoaging and psoriasis yet robust research is lacking one review suggests oral curcumin in particular may be an effective and safe treatment option for psoriasis a chronic inflammatory skin disease but more studies are needed before doctors make recommendations 37 according to the authors of another review topical curcumin treatments may be useful in treating skin disorders especially as past research suggests curcumin is relatively safe even at high doses but curcumin s bright yellow orange color poor solubility and poor stability at a high ph make it an unappealing topical skin treatment 38 and thanks to its poor bioavailability chances are you d have to use curcumin to complement not replace other skin treatments according to the authors of one study 39 
10 turmeric protects your body from free radicalsantioxidants help protect your body against damage caused by free radicals a class of highly reactive atoms that are generated in our bodies and found in environmental pollutants like cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals 40 too much exposure to free radicals can mess with the fats proteins and even dna in your body which may lead to a number of common diseases and health conditions including cancer arthritis heart disease and alzheimer s 40 therefore antioxidant rich spices like turmeric may play a role in protecting you from free radical damage curcumin in particular is able to scavenge different types of free radicals control enzymes that neutralize free radicals and prevent certain enzymes from creating specific free radical types according to a review 41 11 turmeric may work as an anti aging supplementcurrently there s no evidence that turmeric or curcumin directly influence longevity but thanks to their ability to fight inflammation protect your body against free radicals and potentially delay brain degeneration and other age related diseases turmeric and curcumin may be effective anti aging supplements according to past research 42 studies also suggest that turmeric and curcumin are mostly safe although some negative side effects diarrhea headache rash have been reported at doses ranging from 500 to 12 000 mg 41 12 curcumin may prevent eye degenerationglaucoma a group of eye conditions is one of the leading causes of blindness in people over age 60 43 and unfortunately once your vision is gone it can t be restored 43 but preliminary research shows topical curcumin treatments may help protect the eyes against degeneration researchers applied a proprietary curcumin eye drop solution to rats two times per day for three weeks by the end of the study the untreated rats experienced a 23 percent reduction in retinal cells compared with the treatment group suggesting that loss was prevented by the curcumin treatment 44 the study findings sound impressive but more studies are needed to determine if curcumin is effective in preventing eye degeneration in humans
