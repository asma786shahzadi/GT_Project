post menopausal women may be more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat that increases their risk of events like heart attacks and strokes when they experience stressful events insomnia depression or strain in their social lives a new study suggests the study focused on what s known as atrial fibrillation which develops when the upper chambers of the heart stop working in coordination with the lower chambers resulting in an irregular often rapid heart rate and reduced blood flow while advanced age as well as conditions like obesity diabetes and high blood pressure are well known risk factors for atrial fibrillation the role of psychological and social factors isn t as clear for the new study researchers followed almost 84 000 post menopausal women for an average of more than a decade none of them had atrial fibrillation when they joined the study but almost 24 000 of them or nearly 29 percent developed this heart disorder by the end of the follow up period women who experienced a cluster of symptoms including depression insomnia and stressful life events were 8 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than participants who didn t have these experiences according to study results published in the september 2023 journal of the american heart association similarly women who experienced social strain in their lives were 4 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than those who didn t we know that age is one of the strongest predictors of acquiring atrial fibrillation says the lead study author susan x zhao md a cardiologist at santa clara valley medical center a teaching affiliate of stanford university school of medicine in california but within this cohort of women with similar ages their risk of developing atrial fibrillation was influenced by their psycho emotional well being with all other common atrial fibrillation risk factors being controlled for dr zhao says total lifetime experience with stress and insomnia may raise afib risktwo factors in particular appeared to have the biggest impact on atrial fibrillation risk insomnia was associated with a 4 percent higher risk of atrial fibrillation and stressful life events were associated with a 2 percent greater risk while the study focused on older women who have already gone through menopause the results suggest that paying attention to these risk factors earlier in life may have health benefits down the line zhao says we can extrapolate that it is probably a cumulative lifetime exposure to these stressors that predisposes an individual to developing atrial fibrillation zhao says just as prevention for stroke and heart attack does not start and end at any particular age paying diligent attention to stress reduction and sleep may pay dividends down the road the study wasn t designed to prove whether or how factors like stress or insomnia directly cause atrial fibrillation it only found a correlation between these conditions that they tended to occur together what are the symptoms of afib atrial fibrillation can lead to a number of symptoms including fatigue dizziness chest pain shortness of breath and heart palpitations in some people the condition doesn t cause any symptoms afib can put you at risk for future problems including making it easier for blood clots to form and reducing the heart s ability to pump blood if left untreated over time afib can weaken the heart and lead to stroke or heart failure to address afib doctors typically first recommend lifestyle changes including following a heart healthy diet exercise weight loss reducing stress and limiting alcohol if lifestyle changes aren t enough medications may be prescribed learn more about afib from everyday healthmenopause can increase a person s risk for multiple heart conditionsone limitation of the study is that researchers assessed psychological and social factors at just a single point in time when participants joined the study it s possible that things like stress levels or sleep quality changed over the study period in ways that influenced the results but weren t accounted for the researchers noted another drawback of the study is that about 90 percent of the participants were white making it unclear whether results would be similar for women from other racial or ethnic backgrounds it s also unclear whether the findings would apply to women who are younger and haven t yet gone through menopause says rebecca thurston phd a psychiatry professor and the director of the women s biobehavioral health program at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine dr thurston wasn t involved in the new study we know that the menopause transition can render women more vulnerable to several cardiovascular conditions although a caveat is that this is not well established for atrial fibrillation thurston says it is likely that if one is vulnerable to atrial fibrillation for a range of reasons factors like stress and insomnia can increase that vulnerability further even though the study doesn t address whether stress management or improved sleep habits might reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation these things are still worth trying because they have other benefits thurston says these practices will improve mental health and overall well being for those reasons alone they are good practices to engage in she says
