physical activities like going for a jog or resistance training are among the most effective exercises to ease depression either alone or as part of a treatment plan that includes therapy and medications according to a study published on february 14 in the bmj 1 researchers found that although more vigorous activities yielded more significant improvements in depression casual forms of exercise like walking and yoga were also beneficial our findings support the inclusion of exercise as part of clinical practice guidelines for depression particularly vigorous intensity exercise said the authors in a press release health systems may want to offer physical activity as alternatives or along with other established interventions to lessen both depression and the associated health risks that can come along with it they noted overall the findings confirm and strengthen previous research that s shown exercise to be a useful treatment for clinically diagnosed depression says benson hoffman phd an associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at duke university school of medicine in durham north carolina who was not involved in the study the statistical methods used in the analysis highlighted the true effects of different types of exercise and showed the significant benefits that physical activity can have on mood says dr hoffman nearly 3 in 10 u s adults have been diagnosed with depressionaccording to a 2023 gallup poll 29 percent of u s adults report having been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lifetime nearly 10 percentage points higher than in 2015 2 depression is associated with an increased likelihood of heart disease diabetes stroke chronic pain and alzheimer s disease 3 analysis included more than 200 clinical trials of exercise and depressionalthough exercise is often recommended for depression guidelines and previous reviews offer conflicting findings on what exercises and intensity levels provide the most benefit and how exercise should be prescribed to provide further clarity researchers combed through databases looking for randomized trials that compared exercise as a treatment for depression established treatments like antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy active controls including usual care social support placebo tablets or no treatment at allthey found more than 200 relevant trials involving 14 170 participants with depression researchers considered factors such as the type intensity and frequency of each exercise intervention as well as potentially influential factors such as participants sex age and baseline levels of depression highlights from the analysis included in the studies that compared exercise with usual care results showed large reductions in depression for dance results showed moderate symptom reductions for walking or jogging yoga strength training mixed aerobic exercises and tai chi or qigong moderate and clinically meaningful effects were also found when exercise was combined with ssris or therapy suggesting that exercise could provide added benefit to traditional treatments exercise was effective for people with and without other health conditions and with different baseline levels of depression yoga was more effective in improving depression among older adults while strength training was more effective among younger people although walking or jogging were effective for both men and women strength training was more effective for women and yoga or qigong was more effective for men why did participants sex affect the benefits of certain types of exercise it s not really clear why sex appeared to be associated with which forms of exercise were more beneficial the authors wrote it could be that the benefits were greater in activities that were somewhat new or novel to the participants says steven wengel md a psychiatrist at nebraska medicine in omaha who was not involved in the study it s just a hypothesis but generally speaking perhaps few women had participated in strength training previously or in men perhaps fewer had tried yoga and so when they did those activities they experienced a greater benefit he says more vigorous exercise had greater benefits in reducing depressionalthough light physical activity such as walking and yoga provided clinically meaningful effects the benefits were greater for vigorous exercise such as running and interval training according to the analysis it makes sense that there s a dose effect with exercise the higher the intensity of exercise the bigger the effects if a little is good a lot may be better in people who can safely exercise says dr wengel but in some people because of cardiac conditions or health conditions it may not be safe for them to participate in higher intensity activities before you start exercising especially if you re interested in vigorous exercise check with your physician first he says why exercise may help with depressionalthough it s not completely understood why exercise helps with depression it s likely due to a combination of factors says wengel there is a social aspect to some types of exercise that could add to its effects like when you re taking an exercise class or going for a walk with a friend we know that being around other people can raise our mood he says the authors also point to the benefits of being outside in green space for people who are walking or doing yoga outdoors in a park they could be getting additional stress lowering perks along with the benefits of the activity says wengel finally there s evidence that physical activity increases a brain chemical called brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf says wengel bdnf appears to be really good for the brain to put it simply it seems to make neurons happier and healthier 4 there s also a basic principle with depression that behavioral activation is helpful says hoffman getting up and accomplishing something anything can increase your ability to do other things it increases your self confidence especially if you re seeing results for example seeing yourself getting stronger and shows that you can achieve things he says clear direction led to greater benefitsinterestingly the study found that when people had more autonomy for example they were told to exercise more but not given specifics on what activity or how much activity the observed benefits were weaker that makes a lot of sense to me as a physician the more specific the exercise prescription the more effective it was so in other words just telling a patient that they should get more exercise probably isn t very helpful instead we should talk to them about what they like to do and what has worked for them before and then give them a specific prescription tailored to their needs and preferences says wengel exercise isn t a replacement for antidepressant medicationbecause medication helps some people with depression those on medication should keep taking it says the lead study author michael noetel phd a senior lecturer in the school of psychology at the university of queensland in st lucia australia but given it also has so many health benefits exercise deserves to be a primary treatment for depression alongside therapy says dr noetel exercise improves your mood while also improving dozens of other areas of your health and therapy improves your mood while also helping overcome specific problems you re facing he says none of these treatments are silver bullets but given how debilitating it is to have depression almost all patients should be offered both exercise and therapy says noetel tips for starting activity if you have depression we know that when people have clinical depression their energy tends to be low and their motivation tends to be low and so it s oftentimes especially hard for them to get started says wengel and we don t want to lay more guilt on them about what they should be doing he adds be practical and find ways to start small he suggests you don t have to dive in and immediately get 30 minutes of exercise a day start by taking a walk around the block or do a few minutes of yoga whatever is practical for you do that consistently and then build on it says wengel
