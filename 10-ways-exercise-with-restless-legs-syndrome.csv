s almost a catch 22 where you should exercise to try to sleep better but you can t sleep because of the restless leg says lawrence schmetterer md a vascular and thoracic surgeon practicing in northeastern ohio why you should exercise if you have restless legs syndromeaccording to dr schmetterer exercise increases blood flow and of particular significance improves venous return the rate of blood flow back up through the veins toward the heart why is that important for rls rls says schmetterer is often associated with venous insufficiency a condition in which the veins in your legs don t send blood back to your heart at a normal rate by exercising moving the muscles and stretching you re creating a pumping mechanism that will improve the flow of blood out of the leg and reduce the symptoms of venous insufficiency says schmetterer exercise also enhances the release of dopamine which is known as the feel good hormone says schmetterer rls may be linked to a problem with the way your brain manages dopamine according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke which is why some medications for this condition mimic the effects of dopamine in your brain in addition schmetterer says exercise generally stimulates the release of endorphins which are painkillers and mood elevators and helps alleviate discomfort and improve sleep quality he also notes that stress reduction is a benefit of exercise and stress anxiety and depression are all known to worsen restless leg symptoms finally exercise is known to improve sleep overall if you re exercising you
