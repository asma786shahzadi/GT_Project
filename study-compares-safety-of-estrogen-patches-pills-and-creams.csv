for women older than 45 a pill form of estrogen only hormone therapy to treat hot flashes night sweats and other menopausal symptoms may increase the risk of a high blood pressure diagnosis as compared with hormone therapy via patch or vaginally according to a new study published june 5 in hypertension this is the largest study ever to look at women who are taking only estrogen and have never taken an estrogen progesterone combination the more common form of hormone therapy according to the authors most of the time the combination uses progestin a synthetic form of progesterone an estimated 80 percent of people going through menopause have symptoms some of which can be very bothersome and last for up to seven years says a coauthor of the study sofia b ahmed md a professor of medicine at the university of calgary in alberta the north american menopause society nams and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog recommend hormone replacement therapy ht or hrt as a first line treatment for menopausal symptoms also called vasomotor symptoms of menopause the goal of our study was really to give women and their healthcare providers as much information as possible when they make decisions about whether hormone replacement therapy is appropriate as well as what type and how it is delivered dr ahmed says estrogen only hormone therapy is most common for women who have had a hysterectomyprevious research has shown that specific types of hormone therapy are associated with higher rates of heart disease according to the authors for this study researchers focused on women taking estrogen only hormone therapy to see how the route of administration and the type of estrogen affected blood pressure typically estrogen only therapy is prescribed for women who ve had their uterus removed while estrogen progesterone combination therapy is prescribed for women who still have their uterus says nieca goldberg md the medical director of atria new york city and a clinical associate professor of medicine at nyu grossman school of medicine dr goldberg who volunteers with the american heart association was not involved in the study pill form of estrogen associated with the highest risk of high blood pressurethe study included a total of 112 240 women ages 45 years and older who filled at least two consecutive prescriptions a six month cycle for estrogen only hormone therapy the information came from health administrative data from alberta between 2008 and 2019 high blood pressure was also identified via health records the study subjects received estrogen three ways as pills transdermally with patches and via vaginal creams or suppositories the two most common forms of estrogen used by study participants were estradiol a synthetic form of estrogen that most closely mimics what is naturally produced in women s bodies before menopauseconjugated equine estrogen an animal derived form of estrogen and the oldest type of estrogen therapykey findings of the study included women taking estrogen pills had a 14 percent higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those using transdermal estrogen and a 19 percent higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those using vaginal estrogen creams or suppositories after accounting for age a stronger association was seen among women younger than 70 than women older than 70 compared with estradiol conjugated equine estrogen was associated with an 8 percent increased risk of high blood pressure those taking estrogen for a longer period of time or taking a higher dose had a greater risk of high blood pressure the authors wrote because women with an intact uterus are usually prescribed an estrogen progestin combination these findings may not apply to them noted the authors the study is sizable but has certain limitationsthe strength of this study is its size and that it was population based capturing all women in alberta says susan reed md mph a professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at uw medicine in seattle who was not involved in the research but there are several limitations to consider when interpreting these findings says dr reed the study uses electronic health data to ascertain a diagnosis of high blood pressure rather than following individuals through time and actually measuring their blood pressure to show changes through time such as prior to starting a medication and after starting the medication and comparing those on ht versus those not taking ht she says there is no control group in this study of individuals who are not taking ht this is always important she says age is the greatest risk factor for high blood pressure in midlife womenhypertension or high blood pressure is a condition that makes the heart work harder than normal if left untreated it increases the risk of heart attack stroke and other health conditions according to the aha we know that far and away the greatest risk factor for hypertension in midlife females is age says reed when we assess the reasons for hypertension at midlife among those not taking ht two thirds of the increase in hypertension can be attributed to aging and one third appears to be related to hormone changes which is lower estrogen and progesterone and higher levels of a hormone called follicle stimulating hormone she says the risk of hypertension is primarily dictated by age rather than ht use says stephanie faubion md the director at the center for women s health at the mayo clinic in jacksonville florida and the medical director of the north american menopause society dr faubion was not involved in the study all women should be monitored or screened for cardiovascular risk factors regardless of whether they are on hormone therapy or not she says most women get hormone therapy via patches not pillsdoctors don t commonly administer estrogen in pill form says dr faubion the majority of women are started on transdermal hormone therapy now if cost is an issue though some women may opt for a pill because oral estradiol is the least expensive option she says most women taking oral estrogen can keep doing sowomen who are already taking estrogen pills and have no issue with hypertension don t need to change what they are doing says faubion there may be some women who experience an increase in blood pressure with oral ht use she says but for the majority of symptomatic women who are under the age of 60 years and within 10 years of menopause onset the benefits of hormone therapy outweigh the risk the most important thing she emphasizes is for a healthcare team to take an individualized approach to hormone therapy that factors in each woman s ongoing symptoms risks and personal preferences this study is important in clinical practice and reminds us that women on hormone therapy should be monitored by their doctors regularly for their blood pressure says goldberg it s also a great opportunity to monitor other risk factors for high blood pressure such as high cholesterol glucose weight and exercise
