"If you typically stick to body weight for your ab and core routine, consider incorporating a resistance band for added benefits. Resistance bands are effective strength training tools. Like free weights (such as dumbbells), resistance bands  make body-weight ab and core exercises more challenging. Stretching or elongating the band increases the resistance, and stimulates strength gains in working muscles. In this case, the ab and core muscles. The ab and core muscles include the rectus abdominis (a superficial muscle that extends from your ribs to the front of your pelvis) and the obliques (muscles that run along either side of your torso). The rectus abdominis flexes (bends) the spine, while the obliques help your trunk twist and bend to either side, per the American Council on Exercise (ACE). And the core is more than just vanity muscles. It also includes deep muscles that run from the hips to the shoulders on both sides of your body, says Aimee Nicotera, an American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) certified personal trainer in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. These deep core muscles coordinate to provide stability for the spine. “The core connects your upper and lower body and allows for the transfer of force between the two,” Nicotera explains. Resistance bands can teach the core muscles to transfer force safely and efficiently during sports, exercise, and daily life. “When resistance bands are utilized for training the core, especially rotational or anti-rotational patterns, this can be highly beneficial for increasing strength and power,” says Marty Miller, a doctor of health sciences, a National Athletic Trainers’ Association certified athletic trainer, and the vice president of education and training at Technogym North America in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Rotational exercises involve twisting the trunk — something we naturally do every day. Meanwhile, anti-rotational exercises challenge your ab and core muscles to resist rotation. Both exercise types train your core muscles to work together to protect the spine during movement. This enhances spine stability, which reduces the risk of pain and injuries, per a research review.Incorporating a band into exercises gives your ab and core muscles more resistance to overcome, which can make these muscles even stronger. Plus, you can’t ignore the accessibility of resistance bands. “Most of my clients find bands easy to use, comfortable enough to hold, versatile, effective, and inexpensive,” Nicotera says. RELATED: How to Get Started With Resistance Bands: An Absolute Beginner’s Guide7 Resistance Band Exercises to Build Ab and Core StrengthThis routine from Nicotera targets every muscle in the core. You’ll need a loop resistance band or therapy band with plenty of stretch — a mini band won’t work. It’s best to start with the lightest resistance level available and progress to heavier resistance levels as you get stronger.Do the exercises in order, resting as needed. When you finish the last exercise, return to the beginning. Complete two to three rounds in total. Nicotera recommends doing this circuit once or twice a week to build ab and core strength.1. Banded Bicycle Hovers"
"Sit on the floor. Loop a resistance band around both feet so it runs over the top of each foot (where shoelaces would be) and set your feet wide enough apart on the floor so that tension holds the loop in place. Lie face up with your knees bent and feet
    flat on top of the band. Interlace your fingers behind your head. Pull your abdominals in and lift your knees directly over your hips, feet flexed, still holding the band in place. From this position, extend your left leg straight out in front of
    you (making a 45-degree angle with the floor) and stretching the band, while twisting your upper body toward your right knee so your left elbow extends toward your left knee. Hold 3 to 5 seconds, and then switch sides. Alternate sides for 1 minute.
    
2. Banded Tabletop Toe Taps"
"Sit on the floor with your knees bent. Loop a band around your legs so it rests just above your ankles and set your feet flat on the floor far enough apart to feel tension in the band. Lie on your back and place your hands behind your head, elbows wide.
    Brace your abdominals as you lift your knees directly over your hips, toes pointed. Slowly lower your toes from this position until they tap the floor and return to start. Be sure not to arch your back. Perform the move for 1 minute.
3. Standing Resistance Band Chops"
"Stand with your feet slightly wider than your shoulders. Loop a band around both arms just above your wrists and pull your arms apart until you feel some tension. Maintaining that tension, lift your arms overhead and to the right while pivoting on your
    left foot to rotate your left hip in the same direction. Then, in a fluid motion, bring your arms down toward the outside of your left hip, bending your knees and pivoting on your right foot to rotate your right hip. Keep your arms straight as you
    move, and maintain constant tension in the band. Repeat for 1 minute and switch sides. 4. Standing Resistance Band Windmills"
"Stand with your feet between hip- and shoulder-width apart. Turn the toes slightly to the right. Place one end of a band under your left foot and hold the other end with your left hand. Extend the left arm straight overhead so you feel tension in the
    band, and, if possible, gaze up at the left hand. Keeping your spine long and chest facing forward, shift your left hip to the left as you reach your right hand toward your right ankle. Return to start, keeping your left hand up. Continue for 1 minute.
    Switch sides. 5. Modified Side Plank With Banded Leg Lift"
"Sit on the floor and place the band around your legs above your knees. Lie on the floor on your right side and bend your knees so your feet are behind you. Place your right forearm on the floor with your elbow underneath your shoulder. Brace your core
    and push off the floor so your upper body is supported by your right arm and right knee. Keeping your right knee bent, extend your left leg and place your left foot onto the floor. Then, lift your hips; your body should form a straight line from head
    to foot. From this position, flex your left foot and lift your left leg to hip height before returning your left foot to the floor with control. Repeat for 1 minute, keeping tension on the band at all times. Switch sides. 6. Slow Banded Mountain Climbers"
"Get on all fours with hands directly under shoulders, knees under hips. Loop the band around your feet and extend your legs straight behind you so your weight is on your hands and toes. Keep the feet far enough apart so you feel mild to moderate tension
    in the band. Then, pull the right knee forward, letting the right toes touch the floor (or keep the foot lifted for a greater challenge). Pause briefly before returning your right foot to the floor beside your left foot. Repeat with the left leg.
    Keep the head and neck in a neutral position and hips level as you alternate sides for 1 minute. 7. Banded Walking Bridge"
"Lie face up on the floor with your feet flat and hip-width apart. Lay the band across your hips and hold one end in each hand. Hold the ends against the floor on either side of your hips so the band has mild to moderate tension. Squeeze your glutes to
    lift your hips as high as possible without arching your lower back. If this is enough of a challenge, return your hips to the floor and repeat this movement for 1 minute. If you’d like to do more, keep your hips lifted as you alternate lifting
    one knee toward your chest. Keep your movements controlled and your hips stable; don’t allow your hips to rock from side to side. Continue for 1 minute.

"Strong arms and shoulders are for more than showing off — strengthening these muscles is pivotal for carrying luggage, pushing doors open (and pulling them shut), swinging a pickleball racket, and safeguarding bone health.Dumbbells are a popular option for strengthening the arms and shoulders, but switching to a resistance or elastic band will give your muscles a unique challenge. “Utilizing bands will create a progressive resistance throughout the entire range of motion of the exercise,” says Marty Miller, a doctor of health sciences, a National Athletic Trainers’ Association certified athletic trainer, and the vice president of education and training at Technogym North America in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Whereas dumbbells provide constant resistance, where the tension level doesn’t change at any point in the exercise, elastic bands offer variable resistance. This means the resistance level varies at different phases of the exercise — the more you stretch the band, the more tension your muscles will have to overcome.[1]Resistance bands are effective strength tools for people of all experience levels. Still, they may benefit beginners who are growing accustomed to resistance training. “The main benefit of using resistance bands is that they allow us to increase the resistance during the easier portion of the lift, which can be great for beginners,” says Michael Hamlin, CSCS, the founder of EverFlex Fitness, a fitness facility in Calgary, Canada. For example, doing a chest press (lying on your back and extending your arms to press weight over your chest) with a resistance band allows you to strengthen your chest and arms without being limited by weaknesses at the bottom of the exercise. “Quite often people, usually beginners, are weaker in a deeper range of motion, with their hands near their ribcage, as opposed to the top of the lift with their arms extended,” Hamlin says. By using a resistance band, there will be less tension at the weakest portion of the exercise. RELATED: How to Get Started With Resistance Bands: An Absolute Beginner’s Guide7 Resistance Band Exercises for Strong Arms and ShouldersReady to test the merits of resistance band training on your arms and shoulders? Do the following routine — from Rachel Hall, a National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM)–certified personal trainer in Miami and fitness program director for Body FX — two to three times per week on nonconsecutive days. A large loop band is your best bet for these exercises, but a band with handles can also work. Start with the lightest resistance option and gradually progress to heavier bands as your arms and shoulders get stronger. Complete a brief warm-up before starting the workout. Arm sweeps (begin with arms down at your sides and lift them out to your sides before sweeping them overhead), forward arm circles (extend your arms out to the sides and move them in small forward circles, gradually increasing the size of the circles), backward arm circles (extend your arms out to the sides and move them in small backward circles, gradually increasing the size of the circles), and air punches (punch the air in front of you, alternating arms) will loosen the arm and shoulder joints and get blood flowing to the muscles. Do each movement for 30 seconds and do not rest in between.Move onto the resistance band arm and shoulder routine once you’ve finished your warm-up. Perform the exercises in order, resting 20 to 30 seconds in between. Do three to four sets total.Check with your doctor before attempting this routine if you’re recovering from an arm or shoulder injury, have a chronic condition such as heart disease or diabetes, or haven’t been active.1. Bow and Arrow"
"From a standing position, hold the resistance band in front of your chest at shoulder height, arms extended. Ensure your hands are shoulder-width apart and your palms face the floor. You should feel mild tension in the band. Keeping your right arm extended, pull your left elbow straight back, squeezing your left shoulder blade. Hold briefly and slowly release, returning your left arm to the starting position. Do 10 to 12 repetitions. Switch sides.2. Banded Push-Up"
"Kneel on the floor. Grip both ends of the resistance band and bring it over your head and behind your back. Position the band securely against your upper back, over your shoulder blades. Hold one end of the band in each hand and place your hands flat on the floor so they’re directly beneath your shoulders.Then, step your feet back, one at a time, keeping your feet a comfortable distance apart, so that you’re in a high-plank position with your body forming a straight line parallel to the ground from top of head to heels. (The wider your feet, the more stability you will have.)Slowly bend your elbows backward, lowering your chest until it almost touches the floor. Keep your core tight and back flat. Pause for a moment, then push your body back up into a high-plank position. Do 12 to 16 repetitions. If this variation is too difficult, lower both knees to the ground or omit the band.RELATED: How to Do a Push-Up (and Why They’re So Good for You)3. Front Raise With Rear Delt Fly"
"From a standing position, open the band into a large loop and step both feet on the bottom half, so the band is under the arches of your feet. Grip the upper half of the band with your hands shoulder-width apart, palms facing the front of your thighs. Keeping your arms straight, lift the band to shoulder height. From here, pull your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Pause briefly, then release and lower your hands to your thighs. Repeat. Do 12 to 16 repetitions in total.4. Standing Bear Hugs"
"Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grip both ends of the resistance band and bring it over your head and behind your back. Position the band securely against your back, under your shoulder blades. Extend your arms to the sides, elbows 45 degrees away from the body. From here, press your arms forward and around an imaginary tree, keeping your palms down and elbows slightly bent. Return to start and repeat. Do 16 to 20 repetitions.5. Overhead Triceps Extension"
"From a standing position, open the band into a large loop and step both feet on the bottom half, so the band is under the arches of your feet. Grip the upper half of the band with hands together near your chest and palms facing forward. From here, press the band straight up above your head. Slowly lower your hands behind your head until your elbows are bent 90 degrees, keeping your elbows close to the side of your head. Press your hands back up overhead until your arms are fully extended. Do 12 to 20 repetitions.6. Steeple Press"
"From a standing position, open the band into a large loop and step both feet on the bottom half, so the band is under the arches of your feet. Grip the upper half of the band in each hand, palms up. Then, flip your palms down to roll the band around your hands. (The more times you roll the band around your hands, the greater the resistance.) Bring your hands together in a prayer position in front of your chest. Keeping your palms together, press your arms straight up overhead until they’re fully extended. Pause briefly, then return your hands to a prayer position in front of your chest. Repeat. Do 16 to 20 repetitions.7. Drag Curls"
"From a standing position, open the band into a large loop and step both feet on the bottom half, so the band is under the arches of your feet. Grip the upper half of the band in each hand and allow your arms to hand freely at your sides. Keeping your chest up and shoulders down, pull your elbows behind you and squeeze your biceps to “drag” the band toward your shoulders. Stop once you reach the bottom of your chest, then slowly lower the band to the starting position. Repeat. Do 16 to 20 repetitions.RELATED: The Best Exercises for Strengthening Every Muscle in Your Arms"
"Exercise is a vital component of heart health, but you don’t necessarily need to pour sweat in a high-intensity bootcamp class to reap the benefits. While aerobic, or cardio, exercise like running, cycling, and brisk walking is certainly important
    for strengthening your heart, another type of movement called isometric exercise is gaining attention for its ability to help reduce blood pressure.In fact, recent research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine[1] found that when compared with other forms of physical activity, isometric
    exercise was most beneficial in lowering blood pressure.What Is Isometric Exercise?Isometric exercise is a type of movement that involves static muscle contractions. “The muscle during an isometric contraction develops tension or force but does not result in shortening or lengthening of that muscle and there is no movement of the joint connected to the muscle,” says Jonathan Whiteson, MD, medical director of cardiac rehabilitation at NYU Langone Health in New York City. Examples of isometric exercise include planks, wall sits, and glute bridges. Isometric exercise is a type of resistance training, which research has linked to a number of health benefits including stronger muscles and healthier bones. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services[2] recommends everyone include resistance training in their exercise routine at least two days per week in addition to at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity
    aerobic physical activity. How Does Isometric Exercise Affect Blood Pressure?Cardio exercise has traditionally been the gold standard for improvements to heart health, but isometric exercise is also being recognized for its heart benefits, as well.The study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine compared the effects of various exercise models, including aerobic exercise, isometric exercise, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), dynamic resistance training, and a combination
    of HIIT and isometric exercise. The study authors examined data from 270 randomized controlled trials with more than 15,800 participants that were published between 1990 and 2023.Their analysis showed that isometric exercises led to the most significant reductions in both systolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, and diastolic blood pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries
    between beats. The most significant effect was seen with isometric training of large muscle groups, such as the legs, compared with smaller muscle groups, such as the hand.So what causes this effect on blood pressure with isometric exercises? “Blood pressure rises during isometric muscle contractions as blood vessels in those muscles are constricted and the heart and blood vessels have to ‘work harder’
    to maintain blood flow through those muscles,” Dr. Whiteson explains. “When the isometric contraction is released, the heart and blood vessels ‘relax’ and the blood vessels dilate and blood pressure is reduced.”Is Isometric Exercise Alone Enough to Lower Blood Pressure?Whiteson notes that managing blood pressure is complex and includes a number of different systems in the body, including the nervous system, the hormonal system, and the vascular system.“Exercise, including isometric exercise, improves these nerve, hormonal and vascular changes, the combination of which results in an overall sustained lower blood pressure,” he says. “Regular (daily) ongoing exercise optimizes this process.
    Stopping exercise — being sedentary — reverses this process and blood pressure rises and hypertension can return.”It’s also important to remember that every person is different and the cause for elevated blood pressure and the amount of blood pressure reduction is highly individualized, says Scott Jerome, DO, director of sports cardiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Westminster.“Anything that helps control blood pressure will help heart health,” he says. “Isometric exercise is just one arm of a multimodality total approach to managing high blood pressure. High blood pressure management methods include weight
    control, reduction in salt intake, regular exercise, and medication if needed.”Is Isometric Exercise Right for You?Isometric exercises are considered generally safe for most people, but if you want to incorporate this form of movement into your plan to control blood pressure, talk to your doctor first. “Caution needs to be used when individuals with preexisting poorly controlled hypertension or heart disease perform isometric exercise as there can be an excessive rise in blood pressure and increased strain on the heart resulting in damage to
    the heart like a myocardial infarction [heart attack],” Whiteson says.For this reason, it’s important to breathe during isometric exercise, as holding your breath can result in very high spikes of blood pressure.“At extremes of resistance exercise combined with breath holding, the work the heart has to do to maintain appropriate circulation throughout the body can result in cardiac strain,” Whiteson notes.How to Incorporate Isometric Exercise Into Your RoutineIf you’ve gotten the all clear from your physician, there are easy ways to incorporate isometric exercises into your routine. “We do isometric exercises in many of our daily activities,” Whiteson says. “Carrying a bag in our hands with fingers gripped around the handle is an isometric exercise to the hand and forearm muscles.”Other simple isometric movements include standing on your tippy toes and balancing on one leg and maintaining the position. Planks and wall sits are two very beneficial isometric exercises, as they incorporate a variety of muscle groups, including the arms, legs, and abdominals.To perform a wall sit, stand with your back against the wall and place your feet firmly on the ground about two feet away. Slide your back down the wall and bend your legs at a 90 degree angle as if you’re sitting in a chair. Keep your abdominal muscles
    engaged and remember to breathe. To get into a plank position, lie flat on your stomach and then lift yourself up onto your forearms. Hold this position and then lift your hips off the floor in line with your shoulders. Engage your core and breathe.Both wall sits and planks should be held for 20 to 30 seconds to start and you can gradually increase this time."
"Physical activity is important for everyone, even people living with heart failure.Research has shown that congestive heart failure patients who follow an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program are less likely to be hospitalized and report a better quality of life than those who do not.“Exercise for most heart conditions is very important,” says Ross Brown, MD, an interventional cardiologist with Memorial Hermann in Houston. “It helps strengthen the heart, lowers blood pressure, helps lower stress levels, and can help improve overall mental health.”"
"Most patients will be referred to a cardiac rehab program by their doctors, where their heart rate, ECG, blood pressure, and other physical responses can be monitored while you exercise.“This is a great place to start an exercise program, especially for patients with heart problems,” says Amy Beitel, a physical therapist in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.Under the supervision of specialists, you’ll learn what exercises are safe and appropriate with heart failure. “We can then reassure the patient and help build their confidence that these are the things they can do at home safely once they graduate from the program,” Dr. Brown says.You can also choose to start exercising on your own. But remember that it’s important to speak to your doctor before beginning any form of exercise.Once you get cleared by a physician, start out slow. “Begin exercising for only a few minutes at a comfortable rate,” Beitel says. “Then each day, slowly try to increase the length of time and the intensity of your workout.”When increasing the duration or intensity of the workout, experts recommend using the “talk test”: If you are unable to carry out a conversation while exercising, then you’re most likely overdoing it.The ideal target for patients with mild to moderate heart failure is 30 to 45 minutes of exercise five days a week, Brown says.Getting Started on an Exercise PlanWhen it comes to choosing a type of exercise, experts recommend that patients do physical activities they enjoy the most, though sticking to low-impact activities, like walking, bicycling, or swimming, is best.Beitel advises beginning each exercise with a warm-up, such as marching in place for about five minutes and doing some upper body stretches. At the end of each session, cool down with some more stretching exercises.“Never stop exercising all of a sudden and then sit or lie down, or stand still. This can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded,” she says. “Walk around slowly before you stop.”If you’re having a hard time doing a full 30 minutes, Brown recommends breaking up the time. “Try 5- or 10-minute intervals, spaced with a break in between,” he says.Sometimes, heart failure patients, especially older adults, might feel dizzy or lightheaded with physical activity. If this happens to you, Brown recommends chair exercises. “It's important to keep your feet moving, even if you're sitting down, so just doing some calf pumps or toe raises can actually help you maintain more stable blood pressure to allow you to do more upper body and other exercises.”Importantly, you should never exercise during times when your heart failure is not under control. If you notice any heart failure symptoms, including excessive shortness of breath, chest discomfort, palpitations that do not go away, or increasing fatigue, stop exercising and notify your doctor right away.Beitel also offers these seven tips for exercising safely while living with heart failure:Avoid exercises that require or encourage holding your breath, such as push-ups, sit-ups, planks, and isometric exercises.Wait at least one hour after eating to exercise.Avoid actions that need quick bursts of energy.Exercise when you have the most energy. For most people with heart failure, that is in the morning.Think about exercising with a friend or family member. It’s easier to stay with it when you have a partner, and it can be an enjoyable social time.Don’t exercise if you are sick or have a fever.Avoid exercising outdoors in extreme weather or high humidity."
"When you’re struggling with endometriosis symptoms like pelvic pain, cramping, and excessive bleeding, going for a run or rolling out the mat for a yoga session might seem pretty unappealing. However, working out can actually improve symptoms for some women who have endometriosis, helping them feel better, both mentally and physically.While there isn’t a lot of research on exercise’s impact on endometriosis, some of the results are promising: A 2019 study found that rats with endometriosis that did moderate and intense exercise had a decrease in the size of endometriotic lesions.“Exercise in endometriosis is not well studied, but if a patient tells me that when she works out she feels better, I say, ‘Go do it,’” says Sanjay Agarwal, MD, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Diego. “It’s good for you for many reasons, so go exercise.”The Benefits of Exercising With EndometriosisHere’s how a commitment to fitness might help you soothe some of the symptoms of endometriosis.1. Exercise Can Boost Your Mood. You’ve heard of runner’s high, right? When you work out, your brain produces natural endorphins that can boost your mood, says Hugh Taylor, MD, the chair of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “Exercise is not a cure for endometriosis, but it can certainly help with some of the pain and mood changes that are associated with it.” The mood-boosting effect of exercise is especially important because depression and anxiety sometimes occur along with endometriosis. “There’s naturally a higher incidence of depression and anxiety in people with endometriosis that we believe is actually caused by the endometriosis,” says Dr. Taylor. His research in animal models, published 2018, suggests a direct link between endometriosis and these mental health disorders. More recently, a 2023 review also showed an association between endometriosis, depression, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.For the maximum effect of exercise on your mood, break a sweat. “The more vigorous the exercise,” Taylor says, “the better the endorphin production. Plus, it’s always good for your health, so I generally recommend to any of my patients that some fairly vigorous exercise is a good idea for all of us.”2. Exercise Can Help Relieve Pain. “I think there are many reasons that exercise can be part of a multipronged strategy to treat endometriosis pain,” says Dr. Agarwal. First, when you work out, you loosen a variety of ligaments and muscles, which allows you to move better in spite of your pain. What’s more, Agarwal says, “exercise can prompt the release of natural opioids-like substances that can help you manage pain.” Another benefit is that when you exercise, you can focus on the workout itself instead of your pain. When it comes to research on how exercise affects endometriosis pain or chronic pain due to other conditions, the results are mixed. A 2021 review found that while some studies showed a beneficial effect of exercise on endometriosis pain, others showed no effect or a negative effect. A 2017 review on exercise and chronic pain called for more research on the subject since most studies had small sample sizes."
"3. Exercise Can Restore Strength to Your Pelvic Floor. Some women who have endometriosis can develop scar tissue or adhesions, bands of scar tissue that can bind tissues and organs together. When that happens, physical therapy with a pelvic floor specialist can be helpful, says Taylor. A pelvic floor physical therapist can develop a customized plan for strengthening the muscles and ligaments around your bladder, vagina, and bowels to help you reduce pain and move better. A 2017 study reported that women who did eight weeks of a specialized exercise program experienced a significant reduction in pain. You can find a qualified physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor training in the American Physical Therapy Association’s directory.4. Exercise Benefits Your Whole Body.The benefits of working out are far-reaching, extending throughout the body. Exercise can improve your blood circulation, bringing nutrients and oxygen to your organs and other body systems. In addition, exercise can reduce your estrogen levels, a change that could be helpful in ameliorating endometriosis symptoms, as estrogen is linked to the inflammatory processes that cause pain in endometriosis.What Should Your Exercise Plan for Endometriosis Look Like?Some endometriosis experts are developing specialized programs, such as yoga routines and Pilates workouts, specifically designed to help women with the condition. Some women enjoy these types of activities, although according to a 2019 study, about 16 percent of participants reported increased pelvic pain with activities like yoga and Pilates. If running is more your speed, consider this: The Endometriosis Foundation of America participates as a charity team in various marathons across the country.All in all, more research is needed to determine the optimal type and amount of exercise for women with endometriosis. While some women with the condition may be able to do vigorous cardio, others may need something more gentle.So it’s important to find the type of workout that appeals to you and that you can do comfortably, and talk to your doctor about it. Your doctor can advise you as to whether you’re on the right track with a safe exercise plan that won’t aggravate endometriosis symptoms like pelvic pain.“It’s no good for me to say to do one thing or another if you want to do something else,” says Agarwal. “The exercise you want to do and will do — that’s the one that’s going to work best.”"
"Physical activities like going for a jog or resistance training are among the most effective exercises to ease depression, either alone or as part of a treatment plan that includes therapy and medications, according to a study published on February 14 in the BMJ.[1]Researchers found that although more vigorous activities yielded more significant improvements in depression, casual forms of exercise like walking and yoga were also beneficial.“Our findings support the inclusion of exercise as part of clinical practice guidelines for depression, particularly vigorous-intensity exercise,” said the authors in a press release. Health systems may want to offer physical activity as alternatives or along with other established interventions, to lessen both depression and the associated health risks that can come along with it, they noted.“Overall, the findings confirm and strengthen previous research that’s shown exercise to be a useful treatment for clinically diagnosed depression,” says Benson Hoffman, PhD, an associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, who was not involved in the study.The statistical methods used in the analysis highlighted the true effects of different types of exercise — and showed the significant benefits that physical activity can have on mood, says Dr. Hoffman.Nearly 3 in 10 U.S. Adults Have Been Diagnosed With DepressionAccording to a 2023 Gallup poll, 29 percent of U.S. adults report having been diagnosed with depression at some point in their lifetime, nearly 10 percentage points higher than in 2015.[2]Depression is associated with an increased likelihood of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, chronic pain, and Alzheimer’s disease.[3]Analysis Included More Than 200 Clinical Trials of Exercise and DepressionAlthough exercise is often recommended for depression, guidelines and previous reviews offer conflicting findings on what exercises and intensity levels provide the most benefit and how exercise should be “prescribed.”To provide further clarity, researchers combed through databases looking for randomized trials that compared:Exercise as a treatment for depression Established treatments like antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy Active controls, including usual care, social support, placebo tablets, or no treatment at allThey found more than 200 relevant trials involving 14,170 participants with depression. Researchers considered factors such as the type, intensity, and frequency of each exercise intervention, as well as potentially influential factors such as participants’ sex, age, and baseline levels of depression.Highlights from the analysis included:In the studies that compared exercise with usual care, results showed large reductions in depression for dance. Results showed moderate symptom reductions for walking or jogging, yoga, strength training, mixed aerobic exercises, and tai chi or qigong.Moderate and clinically meaningful effects were also found when exercise was combined with SSRIs or therapy, suggesting that exercise could provide added benefit to traditional treatments.Exercise was effective for people with and without other health conditions and with different baseline levels of depression.Yoga was more effective in improving depression among older adults, while strength training was more effective among younger people.Although walking or jogging were effective for both men and women, strength training was more effective for women, and yoga or qigong was more effective for men.Why Did Participants’ Sex Affect the Benefits of Certain Types of Exercise?It’s not really clear why sex appeared to be associated with which forms of exercise were more beneficial, the authors wrote.It could be that the benefits were greater in activities that were somewhat new or novel to the participants, says Steven Wengel, MD, a psychiatrist at Nebraska Medicine in Omaha who was not involved in the study. “It’s just a hypothesis, but generally speaking, perhaps few women had participated in strength training previously, or in men, perhaps fewer had tried yoga, and so when they did those activities, they experienced a greater benefit,” he says. More Vigorous Exercise Had Greater Benefits in Reducing DepressionAlthough light physical activity such as walking and yoga provided clinically meaningful effects, the benefits were greater for vigorous exercise such as running and interval training, according to the analysis.“It makes sense that there’s a dose effect with exercise. The higher the intensity of exercise, the bigger the effects. If a little is good, a lot may be better in people who can safely exercise,” says Dr. Wengel.“But in some people, because of cardiac conditions or health conditions, it may not be safe for them to participate in higher intensity activities. Before you start exercising, especially if you’re interested in vigorous exercise, check with your physician first,” he says.Why Exercise May Help With DepressionAlthough it's not completely understood why exercise helps with depression, it’s likely due to a combination of factors, says Wengel.“There is a social aspect to some types of exercise that could add to its effects, like when you're taking an exercise class or going for a walk with a friend. We know that being around other people can raise our mood,” he says.The authors also point to the benefits of being outside in “green space.” For people who are walking or doing yoga outdoors in a park, they could be getting additional stress-lowering perks along with the benefits of the activity, says Wengel.Finally, there’s evidence that physical activity increases a brain chemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), says Wengel. “BDNF appears to be really good for the brain. To put it simply, it seems to make neurons ‘happier and healthier.’”[4]There’s also a basic principle with depression that behavioral activation is helpful, says Hoffman. “Getting up and accomplishing something — anything — can increase your ability to do other things. It increases your self-confidence, especially if you're seeing results — for example, seeing yourself getting stronger — and shows that you can achieve things,” he says.Clear Direction Led to Greater BenefitsInterestingly, the study found that when people had more autonomy — for example, they were told to exercise more, but not given specifics on what activity or how much activity — the observed benefits were weaker.“That makes a lot of sense to me as a physician. The more specific the exercise prescription, the more effective it was. So in other words, just telling a patient that they should get more exercise probably isn't very helpful. Instead, we should talk to them about what they like to do, and what has worked for them before, and then give them a specific prescription tailored to their needs and preferences,” says Wengel.Exercise Isn’t a Replacement for Antidepressant MedicationBecause medication helps some people with depression, those on medication should keep taking it, says the lead study author Michael Noetel, PhD, a senior lecturer in the school of psychology at the University of Queensland in St. Lucia, Australia. But given it also has so many health benefits, exercise deserves to be a primary treatment for depression, alongside therapy, says Dr. Noetel. “Exercise improves your mood while also improving dozens of other areas of your health, and therapy improves your mood while also helping overcome specific problems you’re facing,” he says.None of these treatments are silver bullets, but given how debilitating it is to have depression, almost all patients should be offered both exercise and therapy, says Noetel.Tips for Starting Activity if You Have Depression“We know that when people have clinical depression their energy tends to be low and their motivation tends to be low, and so it's oftentimes especially hard for them to get started,” says Wengel. “And we don’t want to lay more guilt on them about what they ‘should be’ doing,” he adds.Be practical and find ways to start small, he suggests. “You don’t have to dive in and immediately get 30 minutes of exercise a day. Start by taking a walk around the block or do a few minutes of yoga — whatever is practical for you. Do that consistently and then build on it,” says Wengel."
"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that causes uncomfortable sensations in your legs and an irresistible urge to move them. Symptoms unfortunately tend to worsen later in the day and at night, when you’re trying to sleep. While doctors don’t know exactly what causes it, research shows that moderate exercise and stretching seem to relieve symptoms, according to the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.But while physical activity may be beneficial, RLS can mean there are some hurdles and precautions you should know about to optimize your workout benefits.For one thing, RLS symptoms can range from mild to severe and can occur alongside illnesses such as Parkinson’s and chronic kidney disease. That means how much and what type of exercise you do will depend on your health and physical limitations, notes Krishna M. Sundar, MD, the medical director of the Sleep-Wake Center at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.And, he adds, RLS can interfere with sleep quality, which can negatively impact your cognitive function, mood, overall quality of life, and ability or desire to engage in regular exercise.“There are people who have RLS symptoms that prevent them from sleeping, but it’s almost a catch-22, where you should exercise to try to sleep better but you can’t sleep because of the restless leg,” says Lawrence Schmetterer, MD, a vascular and thoracic surgeon practicing in northeastern Ohio.Why You Should Exercise if You Have Restless Legs SyndromeAccording to Dr. Schmetterer, exercise increases blood flow, and of particular significance, improves venous return (the rate of blood flow back up through the veins toward the heart). Why is that important for RLS?RLS, says Schmetterer, is often associated with venous insufficiency, a condition in which the veins in your legs don’t send blood back to your heart at a normal rate. “By exercising, moving the muscles, and stretching, you’re creating a pumping mechanism that will improve the flow of blood out of the leg and reduce the symptoms of venous insufficiency,” says Schmetterer.Exercise also enhances the release of dopamine, which is known as the “feel-good hormone,” says Schmetterer. RLS may be linked to a problem with the way your brain manages dopamine, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which is why some medications for this condition mimic the effects of dopamine in your brain.In addition, Schmetterer says, “Exercise generally stimulates the release of endorphins, which are painkillers and mood elevators, and helps alleviate discomfort and improve sleep quality.” He also notes that stress reduction is a benefit of exercise, and stress, anxiety, and depression are all known to worsen restless leg symptoms.Finally, exercise is known to improve sleep overall. “If you’re exercising you might sleep better and have better sleep quality,” says Schmetterer.8 Tips to Optimize Exercise When You Have Restless Legs SyndromeGiven the benefits of exercise in RLS management, here’s how to do it safely and effectively.1. Stick to a RoutineA study published in June 2023 in the Journal of Sleep Research found that people with RLS who had any abrupt changes in their exercise habits, such as  a long hike or stopping a routine workout would almost always experience a recurrence of symptoms. In contrast, those who stuck to a consistent pattern of exercise had improved RLS symptoms.2. Avoid Vigorous Exercise Close to BedtimeWhile workouts are good for RLS, engaging in intense exercise close to bedtime should be avoided, says Phyllis Zee, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and the chief of sleep medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “It can potentially increase the heat in leg muscles and may also increase inflammation, which is bad for RLS,” she explains.3. Wear Compression Stockings While Working OutThe stockings work with your muscles to pump blood out of the veins in your legs and keep it from pooling there. Pooled blood can contribute to the symptoms of restless legs, says Schmetterer.4. Choose Moderate ExercisesWhile vigorous exercise, particularly right before bed, can worsen RLS symptoms, research shows that moderate or light exercise programs during the day can help improve them.“In general, we recommend our patients engage in lower-impact exercise such as walking, mild running, and yoga,” says Dr. Zee. “Types of exercise that involve stretching and flexibility tend to be good.”5. Include Lower-Body Stretches in Your Exercise RoutineSchmetterer suggests trying different stretches to see what works best for you. Some areas to pay attention to include the hips, calves, and the front thigh. 6. Make Exercise a Daily HabitMost people with restless legs syndrome should aim for at least 30 to 60 minutes of moderate exercise each day, says Schmetterer.7. Listen to Your BodyPay attention to your body, and avoid activities that make your joints hurt, because this can exacerbate RLS, cautions Schmetterer. Stop exercising if you experience pain, trouble breathing, or chest pressure, and see your doctor. Other general precautions: “It would be the same as exercising for your general health,” he says. Talk to your doctor before you start a new exercise program, especially if you have any health issues such as a cardiovascular or respiratory condition. “If you’re in generally good health but maybe haven’t been as active as you could be or would like to be, then you can start gradually and build up,” says Schmetterer.8. Get a MassageThough not technically exercise, another way to improve RLS symptoms is to massage your calf muscles. “It increases the circulation in your lower extremities,” says Zee."
"There are many known triggers for atrial fibrillation (afib), including alcohol, stress, and intense exercise. (1) But unlike avoiding beverages and stress, which are always positive ways to help you live well with an irregular heartbeat, exercise helps when it’s done right“The relationship between exercise and atrial fibrillation isn’t straightforward,” notes Ayman Hussein, MD, a cardiologist and heart rhythm disorder specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.While most forms of exercise are beneficial to heart health and protective against afib and its symptoms, “exercise is not always protective,” says Dr. Hussein. “Whereas mild- or moderate-intensity exercise is typically protective, intense exercise typically carries a higher risk of atrial fibrillation.”Here’s what you should know about the link between exercise and atrial fibrillation and what exercises are generally considered safe for people with the condition."
"How Exercise Affects Atrial FibrillationAccording to the best available information, the relationship between exercise and atrial fibrillation follows what’s known as a J curve, where in a type of J-shaped diagram, the curve initially falls and then rises above the starting point much like the shape of the letter “J.”This means that the more you exercise, the lower your risk of afib — up to a point. But if you exercise more than a certain amount, your risk rises. (3,4)This trend applies primarily to men, according to Hussein. Women appear to have a lower atrial fibrillation risk with more exercise, even at the highest intensity.High-level athletes are 4 to 8 times more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than the general population, according to a 2017 study. (5)Researchers suspect that years of intense exercise performed by lean, healthy athletes may cause changes in the nervous system and even the structure of the heart itself, leading to an increased risk of the condition. (3)A 2018 article notes that while high-level athletes have the highest risk of afib out of any group based on activity level, people who engage in regular, time-limited exercise have the lowest risk. (4)Within a real-life group of people with afib, more strenuous exercise doesn’t appear to increase the risk of symptoms or adverse outcomes, according to a 2017 study. (6)In that study, 76 people with atrial fibrillation were assigned to a 12-week exercise regimen performed at either 50 or 80 percent of maximal perceived exertion.Daily electrocardiography showed no significant difference in afib symptoms between the two groups, and no serious adverse events were reported. Both groups showed improved cardiovascular fitness. (6)Still, Hussein says, it’s a good idea for people with atrial fibrillation to not push themselves too hard when they exercise. “We typically ask them to do it in moderation, not to push their limits,” he notes.Finding the Right Exercise for Your HeartIf you’re not accustomed to regular exercise and you’ve been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, it’s very important to ease your way into an exercise routine, Hussein emphasizes.People in this situation “need to progressively build strength and endurance,” he says.Eventually, Hussein says, you’ll want to build up to about 30 minutes of physical activity performed at least five days a week, or about 2.5 hours of mild to moderate exercise each week.Regardless of how new you are to exercise, it’s a good idea to keep track of your pulse when you’re exercising, according to Hussein — both at peak activity and while you’re recovering. Your doctor can advise you about the acceptable heart rate range.Here are six types of exercise that may be beneficial if you have atrial fibrillation:1. Cardiac Rehab Training with a specialist in a medically monitored setting may be a good way to start exercising if you’ve been hospitalized for your afib, Hussein says.In a 2017 study, researchers concluded that based on six trials involving exercise-based cardiac rehab for people with afib, the programs appeared to improve exercise capacity. (7)2. Walking Even though walking might seem like a very low-risk activity, “typically, we ask patients up front, at least, not to do any brisk walking,” says Hussein.If you’re just starting out, Hussein recommends walking 5 to 10 minutes daily at first, then adding a minute or two to your walks every week or so.3. Swimming Swimming and other pool-based aerobic exercises can be a good way to work out “but not at a competitive level, from an afib-risk standpoint,” says Hussein.And if you find yourself out of breath or feel like you’re otherwise struggling, it’s important to get out of the pool and sit down for a while, Hussein says.4. Bicycling Using a stationary or regular bicycle can be a good form of activity, but make sure to keep the intensity moderate. Stay away from settings that encourage heavy exertion, such as a Spin class.5. Physical Chores Physical activity doesn’t have to mean doing exercise separately from your daily tasks. In addition to walking to go on errands, you can count gardening, digging, raking, or hoeing as exercise, as long as it gets your heart rate up. ( 8)6. Yoga In a study from 2013, a 60-minute yoga program done twice a week for three months was found to reduce afib episodes and symptoms, reduce depression and anxiety, and improve heart rate and blood pressure in people with atrial fibrillation. ( 9)Remember that no matter what activity you’re doing, if you experience any symptoms related to atrial fibrillation — like lightheadedness or chest pain or pressure — you should stop and rest for a while, says Hussein.And if you have more serious symptoms like intense chest pain, visit a hospital emergency room.In most cases, though, you should be able to accomplish moderate exercise without any risk of causing or aggravating your symptoms.“Aerobic activity is good,” says Hussein, but “don’t push your limits.”"
"Post-menopausal women may be more likely to develop an irregular heartbeat that increases their risk of events like heart attacks and strokes when they experience stressful events, insomnia, depression, or strain in their social lives, a new study suggests.The study focused on what’s known as atrial fibrillation, which develops when the upper chambers of the heart stop working in coordination with the lower chambers, resulting in an irregular, often rapid heart rate and reduced blood flow. While advanced
    age, as well as conditions like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure are well-known risk factors for atrial fibrillation, the role of psychological and social factors isn’t as clear.For the new study, researchers followed almost 84,000 post-menopausal women for an average of more than a decade. None of them had atrial fibrillation when they joined the study, but almost 24,000 of them, or nearly 29 percent, developed this heart disorder
    by the end of the follow-up period.Women who experienced a cluster of symptoms including depression, insomnia, and stressful life events were 8 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than participants who didn’t have these experiences, according to study results published
    in the September 2023 Journal of the American Heart Association. Similarly, women who experienced social strain in their
    lives were 4 percent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation than those who didn’t.“We know that age is one of the strongest predictors of acquiring atrial fibrillation,” says the lead study author, Susan X. Zhao, MD, a cardiologist at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, a teaching affiliate of Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “But within this cohort of women with similar ages, their risk of developing atrial fibrillation was influenced by their psycho-emotional well-being, with all other common atrial fibrillation risk factors being controlled for,” Dr. Zhao says.Total Lifetime Experience With Stress and Insomnia May Raise Afib RiskTwo factors in particular appeared to have the biggest impact on atrial fibrillation risk. Insomnia was associated with a 4 percent higher risk of atrial fibrillation, and stressful life events were associated with a 2 percent greater risk.While the study focused on older women who have already gone through menopause, the results suggest that paying attention to these risk factors earlier in life may have health benefits down the line, Zhao says.“We can extrapolate that it is probably a cumulative lifetime exposure to these stressors that predisposes an individual to developing atrial fibrillation,” Zhao says. “Just as prevention for stroke and heart attack does not start
    and end at any particular age, paying diligent attention to stress reduction and sleep may pay dividends down the road.”The study wasn’t designed to prove whether or how factors like stress or insomnia directly cause atrial fibrillation; it only found  a correlation between these conditions, that they tended to occur together.What Are the Symptoms of Afib?Atrial fibrillation can lead to a number of symptoms, including fatigue, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. In some people, the condition doesn’t cause any symptoms.Afib can put you at risk for future problems, including making it easier for blood clots to form and reducing the heart’s ability to pump blood. If left untreated, over time afib can weaken the heart and lead to stroke or heart failure.To address afib, doctors typically first recommend lifestyle changes, including following a heart-healthy diet, exercise, weight loss, reducing stress, and limiting alcohol. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, medications may be prescribed. Learn More About Afib From Everyday HealthMenopause Can Increase a Person’s Risk for Multiple Heart ConditionsOne limitation of the study is that researchers assessed psychological and social factors at just a single point in time, when participants joined the study. It’s possible that things like stress levels or sleep quality changed over the study period in ways
    that influenced the results but weren’t accounted for, the researchers noted.Another drawback of the study is that about 90 percent of the participants were white, making it unclear whether results would be similar for women from other
    racial or ethnic backgrounds.It’s also unclear whether the findings would apply to women who are younger and haven’t yet gone through menopause, says Rebecca Thurston, PhD, a psychiatry professor and the director of the Women’s Biobehavioral Health Program at the University
    of Pittsburgh School of Medicine; Dr. Thurston wasn’t involved in the new study.“We know that the menopause transition can render women more vulnerable to several cardiovascular conditions, although a caveat is that this is not well established for atrial fibrillation,” Thurston says. “It is likely that if one is
    vulnerable to atrial fibrillation for a range of reasons, factors like stress and insomnia can increase that vulnerability further.”Even though the study doesn’t address whether stress management or improved sleep habits might reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation, these things are still worth trying because they have other benefits, Thurston says. “These practices
    will improve mental health and overall well-being — for those reasons alone, they are good practices to engage in,” she says."
"For women older than 45, a pill form of estrogen-only hormone therapy to treat hot flashes, night sweats, and other menopausal symptoms may increase the risk of a high blood pressure diagnosis,
 as compared with hormone therapy via patch or vaginally, according to a new study, published June 5 in Hypertension.This is the largest study ever to look at women who are taking only estrogen and have never taken an estrogen-progesterone combination (the more common form of hormone therapy), according to the authors. Most of the time, the combination uses progestin,
    a synthetic form of progesterone.An estimated 80 percent of people going through menopause have symptoms, some of which can be very bothersome and last for up to seven years, says a coauthor of the study, Sofia B. Ahmed, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of Calgary in Alberta.The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend hormone replacement therapy (HT or HRT) as a first-line treatment for menopausal symptoms (also called vasomotor symptoms of menopause).“The goal of our study was really to give women and their healthcare providers as much information as possible when they make decisions about whether hormone replacement therapy is appropriate, as well as what type and how it is delivered,”
    Dr. Ahmed says.Estrogen-Only Hormone Therapy Is Most Common for Women Who Have Had a HysterectomyPrevious research has shown that specific types of hormone therapy are associated with higher rates of heart disease, according to the authors. For this study, researchers focused on women taking estrogen-only hormone therapy to see how the route
    of administration and the type of estrogen affected blood pressure.Typically, estrogen-only therapy is prescribed for women who’ve had their uterus removed, while estrogen-progesterone combination therapy is prescribed for women who still
    have their uterus, says Nieca Goldberg, MD, the medical director of Atria New York City and a clinical associate professor of medicine at NYU
    Grossman School of Medicine. Dr. Goldberg, who volunteers with the American Heart Association, was not involved in the study.Pill Form of Estrogen Associated With the Highest Risk of High Blood PressureThe study included a total of 112,240 women ages 45 years and older who filled at least two consecutive prescriptions (a six-month cycle) for estrogen-only hormone therapy. The information came from health administrative data from Alberta between
    2008 and 2019.High blood pressure was also identified via health records.The study subjects received estrogen three ways: as pills, transdermally (with patches), and via vaginal creams or suppositories.The two most common forms of estrogen used by study participants were:Estradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen that most closely mimics what is naturally produced in women’s bodies before menopauseConjugated equine estrogen, an animal-derived form of estrogen and the oldest type of estrogen therapyKey findings of the study included:Women taking estrogen pills had a 14 percent higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those using transdermal estrogen, and a 19 percent higher risk of developing high blood pressure than those using vaginal estrogen creams
        or suppositories. After accounting for age, a stronger association was seen among women younger than 70 than women older than 70.Compared with estradiol, conjugated equine estrogen was associated with an 8 percent increased risk of  high blood pressure.Those taking estrogen for a longer period of time, or taking a higher dose, had a greater risk of high blood pressure, the authors wrote.Because women with an intact uterus are usually prescribed an estrogen-progestin combination, these findings may not apply to them, noted the authors.The Study Is Sizable but Has Certain LimitationsThe strength of this study is its size and that it was population-based, capturing all women in Alberta,  says Susan Reed, MD, MPH, a professor emeritus of
    obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine in Seattle who was not involved in the research.But there are several limitations to consider when interpreting these findings, says Dr. Reed.“The study uses electronic health data to ascertain a diagnosis of high blood pressure, rather than following individuals through time and actually measuring their blood pressure to show changes through time, such as prior to starting a medication
    and after starting the medication and comparing those on HT versus those not taking HT,” she says.“There is no control group in this study of individuals who are not taking HT; this is always important,” she says.Age Is the Greatest Risk Factor for High Blood Pressure in Midlife WomenHypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition that makes the heart work harder than normal. If left untreated, it increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other health conditions, according to the AHA.“We know that far and away the greatest risk factor for hypertension in midlife females is age,” says Reed.“When we assess the reasons for hypertension at midlife among those not taking HT, two-thirds of the increase in hypertension can be attributed to aging and one-third appears to be related to hormone changes, which is lower estrogen and progesterone,
    and higher levels of a hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone,” she says.“The risk of hypertension is primarily dictated by age rather than HT use,” says Stephanie Faubion, MD, the    director at the Center for Women’s Health at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, and the medical director of the North American Menopause Society. Dr. Faubion was not involved in the study. “All
    women should be monitored or screened for cardiovascular risk factors — regardless of whether they are on hormone therapy or not,” she says.Most Women Get Hormone Therapy via Patches, Not PillsDoctors don’t commonly administer estrogen in pill form, says Dr. Faubion. “The majority of women are started on transdermal hormone therapy now.” If cost is an issue, though, some women may opt for a pill “because oral estradiol
    is the least expensive option,” she says.Most Women Taking Oral Estrogen Can Keep Doing SoWomen who are already taking estrogen pills and have no issue with hypertension don’t need to change what they are doing, says Faubion.“There may be some women who experience an increase in blood pressure with oral HT use,” she says. “But for the majority of symptomatic women who are under the age of 60 years and within 10 years of menopause onset, the benefits of hormone
    therapy outweigh the risk.”The most important thing, she emphasizes, is for a healthcare team to take an individualized approach to hormone therapy that factors in each woman’s ongoing symptoms, risks, and personal preferences.“This study is important in clinical practice and reminds us that women on hormone therapy should be monitored by their doctors regularly for their blood pressure,” says Goldberg. “It’s also a great opportunity to monitor other
    risk factors [for high blood pressure], such as high cholesterol, glucose, weight, and exercise.”"
"The history of menopausal hormone therapy for women began with two men.
One discovered estrogen, the predominant female sex hormone. The other convinced women that if you were past menopause and didn’t replace this hormone, you weren’t truly female.
Ever since, hormone therapy has had its ups and downs, creating confusion for women seeking relief from hot flashes or vaginal dryness. Which is a shame, says Stephanie Faubion, MD, the director of the Center for Women's Health at Mayo Clinic and
    the medical director of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), because the science is clear that for most women, the benefits of menopausal hormone therapy (HT)
    for symptom relief outweigh any risks.
How did we get all the misperceptions about hormone therapy that still muddle decision-making about HT? Read on to learn about its wild history.

"Estrogen Was Discovered in St. Louis in 1929Before you can have hormone therapy, you have to have hormones. Credit for discovering the various forms of estrogen goes to the scientist Edward Adelbert Doisy.In the early 20th century, Doisy and his colleagues developed analytical techniques for measuring various substances in the blood and urine, according to an article in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. When Doisy changed jobs in 1923 to head up the new biochemistry department at the St. Louis University Medical School, he began finding substances to measure. Through this process
    of analyzing the urine and follicular fluids of pigs, Doisy eventually isolated the female sex hormone estrogen.There are three types of estrogens that dominate in different phases of a woman’s life. For women between their first menstruation and menopause, estradiol is the most common.
    Estriol dominates during pregnancy. After menopause, the primary estrogen a woman makes is estrone, notes the Cleveland Clinic."
"Synthetic Hormones First Used for Menstrual CrampsOnce estrogen was discovered, it was only a matter of time before scientists figured out how to turn it into a drug.The first commercial preparation of estrogen was called Emmenin. It was an alcohol-soluble substance derived from extracts of human placentas. A paper published in 1935 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal described this oral solution’s value for treating painful menstrual cramps,
 which go by the medical name dysmenorrhea. RELATED: 10 Ways to Relieve Period Cramps"
"Manufacturing and Mass-Producing Synthetic EstrogenEventually, scientists found they could manufacture estrogen rather than take it from the placenta, by collecting substances from the urine of pregnant mares. When commercial production got going, the drug was named Premarin,
 after ""pregnant mares urine."" Premarin was dominated by estrone, but it contained other estrogen types as well, according to the menoPAUSE blog at the University of Rochester Medical Center. In 1942, Premarin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes, according to an article in the American Journal of Medicine.Interestingly, this happened nearly two decades before the first hormonal birth control pill was approved, in 1960.RELATED: Birth Control in America: A Brief History of ContraceptionAccording to a history of estrogen therapy published in Sexual Medicine Reviews in July 2019, books and publications throughout the
    1950s promoted the use of estrogen therapy, which eventually tripled in use by the mid-1970s."
"The Book That Made Hormone Therapy FamousWithout estrogen, can you still be feminine? It may sound like a crazy question today, but a book published in 1966, Feminine Forever,
 had women asking themselves if they could. Robert A. Wilson wrote that taking estrogen would allow a woman to remain “feminine forever,” and if she didn’t do so, she would not. Wilson claimed that menopause was a preventable event, because women could simply add back the estrogen their body was no longer making by taking hormone pills. With this therapy, a woman’s “breasts and genital organs will not shrivel. She
    will be much more pleasant to live with and will not become dull and unattractive,” the book claimed, per NBC News. Feminine Forever became
 a bestseller, causing women who read it to flock to their gynecologists in droves."
"Demand for Hormone Therapy IncreasesBecause some research in the 1970s showed that estrogen medication was linked to an increase in a woman’s risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus), women who still had their uterus were given a combined hormone treatment of
 both estrogen and synthetic progesterone (called progestin), which would protect her from this problem. According to the article in Sexual Medicine Reviews, “estrogen
    use increased through the 1980s and 1990s among all women, with a corresponding increase in the use of progestin by women with a uterus.” These treatments were initially referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or sometimes, as MedlinePlus explains, estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), or menopausal hormone therapy,
 but this was later changed to hormone therapy (HT).RELATED: Cancer Risks, Signs, Symptoms, Tests, Treatments, and More"
"Another Book Casts Doubt on Hormone TherapyAs women turned HT into a blockbuster drug, some women’s health advocates remained concerned that menopausal women were unknowingly taking part in a vast experiment, since no large-scale research had proved these drugs were safe and effective.An advocate named Barbara Seaman finally got people talking about the risks when her 1977 book, Women and the Crisis in Sex Hormones, vaulted to the bestseller list. Seaman warned of small studies linking HT to breast cancer, strokes, and blood clots. But if the book caused some women to question HT, its effect was short-lived. Observational studies in the 1980s and 1990s began touting another benefit of the drugs: the prospect that they could protect women from the dangers of deadly heart disease.
    One such study was the famous Nurses’ Health Study, which followed nearly 60,000 women through menopause. In a report published in 1996 in the New England Journal of Medicine researchers
 concluded, “We observed a marked decrease in the risk of major coronary heart disease among women who took estrogen with progestin.” RELATED: Your Definitive Guide to Heart DiseaseA Marketing Frenzy Made HT a BestsellerWith so much money to be made from HT, drug companies promoted it extensively to women and gynecologists during the last decades of the 20th century, especially touting its protection for the heart.Their marketing efforts worked. By 1992, Premarin was the No. 1 prescribed drug in the United States. By 1997, its sales exceeded $1 billion, according to the menoPAUSE blog."
"Forever Young? Anti-Aging Momentum BeginsAn article on the history of hormone therapy, published in September 2019 in the journal Medicina, notes that around that time,
    “numerous observational studies suggested that HRT had various benefits, not only with regard to the treatment of menopausal symptoms, but also in the prevention of chronic diseases. Thus, the idea switched from ‘feminine forever’
    to ‘healthy forever.’” 
Women, too, sang the pill’s praises for its potentially wide effects. Gloria Bachmann, MD, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Rutgers’
    Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, wrote in the International Journal of Fertility and Menopausal Studies in
 1995 that HT improved the look of the skin, breast, and muscles, among other things, and therefore plays an important role in boosting a woman’s self-image and self-esteem.A Call for More Scientific Research on Hormone TherapyEven as they prescribed it though, doctors were eager for better clinical trials. They wanted large studies randomizing women to take a pill which they wouldn’t know was HT or a placebo, rather than the observational studies many had been relying
    on."
"The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) Looked at Women Taking HTThey got their first wish with the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a study of some 3,000 older women with cardiovascular disease who were given either HT or a placebo. This randomized controlled trial challenged the theory that HT was beneficial for heart disease. The women were followed for an average of four years. Results of the HERS research appeared in an article published in 1998 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). If hormone advocates had hoped this research would prove the drug protected the heart, they were disappointed.HERS found no benefit of the top-selling HT formulation to prevent cardiovascular events. Women who had taken HT did not have fewer heart attacks than those who didn’t take the pills."
"New Concerns Over HT Risks for Blood Clots, Other DiseaseEven more concerning, the treatment was found to increase the risk of blood clots and gallbladder disease.
 The researchers concluded in their JAMA report that they “do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.” (Although they did say that because blood clots primarily
    occurred early in the treatment cycle, women who had been on HT for years who didn’t have a problem could safely continue.) RELATED: What Is the Gallbladder and What Does It Do?The HERS trial “severely rocked” the boat of hormone therapy, said David Katz, MD, the president of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, in an article in 
    Huffington Post. HT had previously been “a placid sea of prevailing conviction, with only small waves of misgivings,” he writes. Those waves were now much more intense."
"The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) LaunchesThe Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) was the first national randomized clinical trial to track hormone therapy in healthy post-menopausal women. Separately, the study also examined other
    issues in this population, including whether vitamin D supplements or low-fat diets are beneficial, according to an article in the journal
    Controlled Clinical Trials.This study, which began enrolling women in 1992, planned to track women until 2005, comparing the health effects
    of those who took combined estrogen-progestin HT — or, for women without a uterus, estrogen-only therapy — with women taking a placebo.RELATED: 10 Things Your Doctor Won’t Tell You About HysterectomySome 160,000 women across the United States were ultimately enrolled in all phases of the study. The women ranged in age from 50 to 79, meaning most were well past the time of menopause. Early Findings From the WHI Couldn’t Be IgnoredIn 2002, the WHI shocked the medical community by announcing in an article in JAMA that, after following the women
    for a mean of five years, it had pulled the plug on the estrogen-plus-progestin arm earlier than expected because the health risks of the trial exceeded the health benefits. New Concerns About HT and Breast Cancer and Heart Disease Halt WHI ResearchThe researchers had discovered that, for each 10,000 person-years, women on these pills would experience eight extra cases of invasive breast cancer, seven additional cardiac events, eight more strokes, and eight additional pulmonary embolisms. But they
    also noted that there would be six fewer colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures. Two years later, the estrogen-only study was also stopped ahead of time, because it also uncovered an increased risk of blood clots. For these women, though, there was no significant increase in breast cancer risk, noted the National Institutes of Health.RELATED: Breast Cancer Signs, Symptoms, Latest Treatments, Tests and More"
"WHI Delivered a Treasure Trove of Health InformationWHI researchers continued following the women even after they stopped their pills. The huge database of the WHI has been analyzed extensively over the years and reported on in more than a hundred different publications.These more comprehensive analyses have brought more nuance to the initial belief that taking HT for vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes is a risky endeavor.Breast cancer Taking estrogen alone (which only women who have had a hysterectomy can safely do) actually decreases breast cancer risks.
 Taking combined hormone therapy, though, does raise risk substantially, and cancers may be more aggressive because they are diagnosed at a more advanced stage. Heart disease Estrogen alone does not increase risk of heart disease, and in women in their fifties — the age when most would take it to deal with hot flashes
        — it actually decreases it. In women taking combined HT, the biggest risk for heart disease happens the first year after starting the drugs, although a small increased risk continues through the entire treatment. Hip fracture Taking estrogen either in combination or alone is actually good for these bones, as it decreases hip fracture risk by a third during the treatment years, with some benefits continuing after the pills are stopped,
        according to an updated overview of WHI study results published in JAMA.Colorectal cancer On combined HT pills, colorectal cancer risk decreases. Estrogen alone has no effect. Stroke and blood clots Stroke risk increases by one-third during treatment for both groups, as does the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs, according
        to the study in JAMA. Other conditions Importantly, the hot flashes and night sweats that are the bane of many women in the menopause transition decreases in women in their early fifties who take HT. Memory is not affected in this age group, although
        women over 65 seem to increase their risk of dementia. Diabetes rates go down in women on HT, but gallbladder disease and urinary incontinence become
 more prevalent. Criticisms of the WHI Research Approach SurfaceOne of the criticisms of the WHI is that a majority of the study participants were more than a decade beyond the menopause transition, and as an article in Fertility and Sterility notes, were “because of their age, predisposed to coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis.” Hormone therapy that is started earlier, the article adds, promises a “more
    favorable risk/benefit outcome.” Clarifying What HT Is — and Is Not — Indicated ForAccording to Dr. Faubion, the medical director of NAMS, all these studies point to the same conclusion: Women should not take HT for the purpose of preventing heart disease or stroke.Instead, the three indications for use of menopausal hormone therapy are vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause [such as vaginal dryness, painful urination, or painful sex], and prevention of bone
    loss and reduction of fracture risk.Most women suffering from hot flashes can safely take HT, according to all the research, Faubion says. “If a woman is under 60 and within 10 years of menopause onset, the benefits of hormone therapy tend to outweigh the risks.” The dose and formulation of the therapy — pills or patches, for example — should be individualized for each woman to make the treatment safer. “And all this needs to be assessed on a regular basis. I have my patients return once a year,
    or sooner if any symptoms change or if anything's new about their personal or family history,” she says."
"What About Other Hormone Formulas and Delivery Methods?Another charge against the WHI study researchers: that they only tested Premarin, the synthetic estrogen made from the pregnant mare urine, and PremPro, the combination of Premarin and the progestin Provera.
 (These were the commonly used HT when the trial started.) “As a result,” notes the article in the journal Medicina, “the WHI findings did not answer doubts about the safety and effectiveness of other HRT formulations, regimens, and delivery methods.” For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) notes that forms of therapy not taken by mouth (such as skin patches, sprays, rings, and others) may have less risk of causing deep vein thrombosis than those
    taken by mouth."
"Are Bioidentical Hormones Any Better?Questions raised after the 2002 WHI results caused some doctors and women to advocate for bioidentical hormones — those made from plant sources, sometimes called “human identical hormones.” One early voice for bioidenticals was the actress
    Suzanne Somers, whose 2004 book, The Sexy Years, claimed that “natural”
    bioidentical hormones were the secret to Somers’s youthfulness. Or, as the subtitle says, “fabulous sex, great health, and vitality.” Some doctors believe women fare better when they use bioidentical hormones. Felice Gersh, MD, a gynecologist and integrative medicine physician in Irvine, California, who is on the consultative faculty at the University of Arizona College of Medicine
    in Tucson, says these hormones are closer to what is naturally found in the body. Pharmaceutical hormones “can bind to human hormone receptor sites but absolutely do not have the same effects as do natural, or human-identical, hormones,”
    she says.In an editorial in the journal Heart published online in February 2020, Dr. Gersh advocated for most women in the menopause
    transition to be offered bioidentical hormones delivered transdermally (through the skin, typically via a patch or gel) along with micronized progesterone as a way to protect the heart, while aiding menopausal symptoms. This should especially be the
    case for women who enter menopause early, the editorial states, because their risk of dying of heart disease is higher than other women’s. ACOG cautions that some bioidenticals are compounded in local pharmacies rather than in larger factories. “Compounding pharmacies must be licensed, but they do not have to show the safety, effectiveness, and quality control that the FDA requires
    of drugmakers.” That’s why ACOG recommends FDA-approved hormone therapy over compounded hormone therapy.RELATED: Healthy Sex: The Ultimate Guide"
"Hormone Therapy and Midlife Women TodayAccording to the North American Menopause Society, HT is still the most effective treatment
    for the hot flashes and vaginal dryness that come with menopause. Because of the risks, women wanting relief from these symptoms should work with their doctors to individualize
    a treatment plan. For women younger than 60 or those who went through the menopause transition less than 10 years ago (and have no contraindications), the benefit-to-risk ratio may make HT worthwhile, NAMS states. The case is less clear for older women or those further
    from the change. For them, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism,
 and dementia, the society says, although this doesn’t mean they should never go on HT.RELATED: Dementia: Causes, Symptoms, Treatment, and MoreMoving Away From Touting Hormones as a Panacea and Recognizing What They Do BestWomen discovered it as early as the 1940s but had to wait decades for scientific proof: Hormone therapy can be extremely beneficial when it comes to treating hot flashes.But it's not without its problems, which occurred when women were told they could take hormones for decades as a way to stay young or stave off cardiovascular and other diseases that increase with aging. That has certainly proven not to be a safe or effective
    strategy.
Every woman considering HT should talk with her doctor about her menopausal symptoms and her personal and family health and disease history to determine whether the treatment is right for them."
"If you’re unsure about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy, you’re not alone — even healthcare providers are exasperated about the mixed messages women receive.So to be clear, hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats (also called vasomotor symptoms, or VMS), according to the 2022 statement of the North American Medical Society (NAMS). For most women under 60, the benefits of therapy for bothersome symptoms and prevention of bone loss outweigh the risks, per the society.Multiple updates from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), however, recommend against the use of hormone therapy for the prevention of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. These updates have exasperated menopause experts and left many women unsure about the safety of hormone therapy.We asked Stephanie Faubion, MD, director of the Center for Women's Health at Mayo Clinic and medical director of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), to dig deeper into the issue of hormone therapy and to put to bed the lingering confusion."
"The conversation has been edited for clarity and length. Everyday Health: The USPSTF issued recommendations against hormone therapy for chronic disease prevention. NAMS agrees it should not be used for that purpose. Why are the recommendations a problem?Stephanie Faubion: Why did they feel a need to come out for a fifth time and say this when no medical society recommends that they be used for that? Our NAMS position statement on hormone therapy certainly does not.The task force statement dissuades people from treating symptoms related to menopause. That’s the problem — people conflate the two.Also, the task force has not researched or made any statements about the use of this therapy for vasomotor symptoms of menopause [such as hot flashes], which of course we’d like to see since the evidence is strong.EH: Tell me about that evidence?SF: Multiple studies have shown that it [hormone therapy] is effective in treating hot flashes.Even in the Women's Health Initiative study [the popular, large-scale study that first reported the unwarranted risks when using hormone therapy for preventing chronic conditions such heart disease], which was not designed to look at vasomotor symptoms, when you look at the women in that study who are in their fifties — the population we are most likely to treat for vasomotor symptoms — the benefits tend to outweigh the risk for those women.EH: As a JAMA editorial notes, when women unnecessarily worry about taking hormone therapy, they instead turn to nonhormonal treatments like antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and dietary supplements. But there isn’t data on the long-term risks of these treatments, is there?SF: That’s exactly right. We have no idea what the long-term effects are of using an antidepressant like an SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor] for symptom management, but I can guarantee you there are some, because no medication is without adverse effects. Also, other drugs used, such as gabapentin [used to prevent seizures and relieve nerve pain], can cause weight gain, sometimes substantial weight gain.There are even reports of women using cannabis, and there’s no data on safety or efficacy there. But for some reason women feel more comfortable using things like that than they do hormone therapy because of publications such as [the recommendations from the USPSTF] that make it all very confusing.There’s a lot of false advertising for supplements and other products that claim there are benefits when they really haven't been proven, and that they’re safer than FDA-approved hormones, and that's simply not true.EH: So what is NAMS’s position on hormone therapy?SF: There are three indications for use of menopausal hormone therapy. One, for vasomotor symptoms — that includes hot flashes and night sweats; two, for genitourinary syndrome of menopause, which may include vaginal dryness, painful urination, or painful sex; third, to help prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk.Each woman should work with her doctor to find the most effective formulation, dose, and route of administration. For example, there's some observational evidence that would suggest maybe a transdermal route of administration (for example, a patch or a cream) is safer than an oral route.All estrogens are not the same; all progestogens are not the same. We give them through different routes of delivery, like oral or a patch or a vaginal ring.And we give them in different doses. So now more than ever, we can start to individualize therapy for women based on their symptoms, past medical history, and family history.And all this needs to be assessed on a regular basis. I have my patients return once a year, or sooner if any symptoms change or if anything's new about their personal or family history. We don't just put somebody on hormone therapy and say, “You're on it forever.”We also don't recommend you stop taking them in three or five years or at a certain age. It's really based on a woman's ongoing need for hormone therapy, and what's new with her health. Some women elect to continue with hormone therapy longer, perhaps because their symptoms persist and nothing else is adequate to manage them.EH: Let’s talk about hot flashes and night sweats. They can be a lot more debilitating than people realize, right?SF: Women are missing work, changing jobs, turning down opportunities for advancement at work because of these symptoms. These are not trivial. They're impacting women's lives, their relationships, and their ability to function.Symptoms are often long in duration — the average length of time is seven to nine years, and 10 percent of women will have symptoms even longer. When women have moderate to severe symptoms for this long, waiting it out probably isn't a great option.EH: What’s your overall message to women about hormone therapy for hot flashes?SF: If a woman is under 60 and within 10 years of experiencing menopause, the benefits of hormone therapy tend to outweigh the risks. The fact is that these USPSTF warnings that come out sound so dire they make women believe that the benefits do not outweigh the risks for management of menopausal symptoms when they do."
"Middle-aged women who experience migraine or hot flashes may not necessarily have an increased risk of heart issues — unless they deal with both these problems for years — two new studies suggest.One of the studies examined data collected from more than 1,900 women starting when most of them were in their twenties, and found that the combination of early adulthood migraine attacks and persistent hot flashes or night sweats during menopause was associated with a 51 percent higher risk of heart attack and a 70 percent greater stroke risk. But only about 7 percent of women had both a history of migraine and persistent hot flashes, according to study results published in the journal Menopause.[1]“Women with migraines only or hot flashes that weren’t prolonged and severe were not at particularly increased risk,” says the lead study author, Catherine Kim, MD, MPH, an associate professor of medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and epidemiology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.“We found that only women with severe prolonged hot flashes preceding or beginning at around age 40, as well as migraine, had greater cardiovascular risk,” Dr. Kim says.In the second study, researchers focused on which factors early in adulthood might have the biggest impact on the risk of persistent hot flashes and night sweats during menopause. Women with migraine were 69 percent more likely to experience persistent menopause symptoms later in life, according to this study, also published in Menopause.[2]What Are Vasomotor Symptoms of Menopause?Hot flashes and night sweats are what’s known as vasomotor symptoms of menopause, meaning that they develop in part as a result of changes in the blood vessels. Migraine is also associated with shifts in the way that blood vessels expand and contract.Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, usually in their forties or fifties. Reduced production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward can lead to a wide range of symptoms, including mood swings, joint pain, vaginal dryness, insomnia, memory problems, and hot flashes and night sweats.How Estrogen Levels Affect Migraine RiskMigraine is also often related to estrogen supplies. This is one reason why some women get migraine attacks during their periods or after ovulation — points during the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels are lower, says Susan Davis, MBBS, PhD, a professor and the director of women’s health research at Monash University in Clayton, Australia.“So it is no surprise that migraines and vasomotor symptoms are associated,” says Dr. Davis, who wasn’t involved in either of the new studies.One limitation of both new studies is that they weren’t designed to determine whether or how migraine or persistent hot flashes might directly cause events like heart attacks or strokes. These studies also didn’t examine whether treating migraine or vasomotor symptoms might influence cardiovascular risk as women age.Even so, all women — whether they have migraine or not — should focus on things within their control early in adulthood that may reduce their risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes down the line, Kim advises.“Even if their cardiovascular risk factors are unremarkable at this age, they may be at greater future risk for heart disease, and they should pay attention to optimizing weight, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and most importantly, cigarette use,” Kim says."
"Gwyneth Paltrow has done it.[1] Cindy Crawford has, too.[2] Same for Selena Gomez and Emma Roberts.[3] It turns out one of the hottest wellness therapies among celebrities is literally hot — well, more like pleasantly warm.The first thing you’ll notice when stepping into an infrared sauna is that it’s not that hot — at least not as piping as a traditional dry heat sauna, which ranges in temperature from 150 to 195 degrees F and heats the surrounding
    air in order to heat your body. Infrared saunas use light to create heat, generating warmth and triggering several possible health benefits.[4]Infrared saunas average about 110 to 120 degrees F upon entry, says Kelly Simms, ND,
 a doctor of naturopathic medicine in Wilmette, Illinois. There are different types of infrared light, determined by their wavelength, which are not in the visible light spectrum. “The wavelength determines the depth of penetration through the
    skin,” she says. Far infrared reaches the greatest depths within the body. Near and medium rays penetrate to a shallower degree.The result? “Your body slowly heats up in an infrared sauna, and you may not start sweating until the end of the session, which [may] last from 30 to 40 minutes [or more],” she explains. Depending on the type of sauna that you’re in,
    it typically works up to a temperature of 140 to 145 degrees F."
"The use of saunas for healing and wellness is nothing new. “Sauna therapy has been used for centuries for relaxation and health promotion,” says Dr. Simms. Whole-body thermal therapy has been used for thousands of years in healing and as part of cultural and spiritual traditions, such as the Native American sweat lodge, the Turkish hammam, and the Russian banya. This type of wellness therapy has a long history in Finnish culture, too, where today most residents bathe in the sauna at least weekly and where most new homes in the country are built with saunas in them.[5]In 1965, the first ceramic infrared sauna using far-infrared wavelengths was patented in Japan, and the therapeutic devices were mostly used by medical practitioners there until infrared saunas made their debut in the United States in the 1980s.[6]"
"So what exactly is an infrared sauna? And how does the therapy work? There are several different types:Far-Infrared TherapyThis type of infrared therapy incorporates the far-infrared wavelengths, which deeply penetrate the skin. Infrared lights do not have a color because they are not visible light. Far-infrared therapy is also called “dry sauna bathing.” The
    benefits described in this story are documented in research on far-infrared sauna bathing.Near-Infrared TherapyAlso called photobiomodulation therapy, or PBMT, this type of infrared therapy uses near-infrared wavelengths to promote healing. This therapy uses sources in the visible light and near-infrared spectrum to regenerate tissue, improve wound healing and
    circulation, and lessen pain and inflammation.[7]
    PBMT may be administered via wearable units that are localized to the affected area, rather than a full-body walk-in sauna.Full Spectrum Infrared TherapyThis type of infrared therapy incorporates all ranges of infrared wavelengths.ChromotherapyThis type of therapy adds colored lights to an infrared sauna, with the idea that certain colors provoke different body responses and benefits.What’s the Difference Between Red Light Therapy and Infrared Sauna Therapy?Infrared and red light are not the same thing. Red light therapy is a different type of therapy that uses low-wavelength light (LED) to treat sun-damaged skin, scarring and wound healing, psoriasis, rosacea, and eczema.[8] While this can be done in a doctor’s office, you can also purchase red light therapy devices to use at home, such as to support healthy skin aging.Infrared heat is not associated with a specific light color, says Simms. But many people also use chromotherapy — or colored lights — for additional health benefits. These lights lie on the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
    indigo, and violet) and are all different wavelengths, which is said to treat medical conditions.[9]
    If chromotherapy is used in an infrared sauna session, it’s for an added benefit."
"“Infrared saunas have been studied for a variety of problems, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pain syndromes, and injuries,” says Melinda Ring, MD, director of the Osher Center for Integrative Health at Northwestern University in Chicago. It’s important to keep in mind that research on infrared therapy is limited, and more
    is needed to explore exactly what benefits it may provide, she explains. What’s more, much of the existing body of literature on the health benefits of sauna bathing is on traditional Finnish saunas and is not specific to infrared therapy. While
    some studies speak to infrared sauna bathing specifically, they are, as a whole, based on small groups of people.Here’s a look at what more recent research suggests infrared sauna may be able to do for your health.1. Infrared Sauna Therapy May Support Heart Health in Certain PopulationsA meta-analysis of nine studies on patients with heart failure concluded that taking an infrared sauna for 15 minutes five times a week for two to four weeks improved
    certain heart biomarkers and measures of heart function in the short term.[10]Another research review explains the potential connection between saunas and heart health.[11] The authors concluded that sauna bathing, including infrared sauna use, may reduce blood
    pressure, improve blood vessel function, reduce inflammation, and calm the nervous system, among other changes. What’s more, the heart’s reaction to sauna bathing may also be akin to walking, something that strengthens the heart and is
    recommended for people who have heart failure.2. It May Be Useful to Boost Exercise BenefitsAn infrared sauna session may stimulate a physiological response similar to exercise. That said, it is not a substitute for exercise. Rather, a short infrared sauna session before a workout can serve as a nice way to warm up your muscles, says Simms.
    Post-exercise, it may also offer some benefits. A small study on 10 men found that using a far-infrared sauna for 30 minutes after a strenuous hour-long strength training workout helped improve neuromuscular recovery. This may be because infrared heat penetrates
    muscles deeper to help relax leg muscles better than room-temperature air. Plus, as the study points out, it’s a pleasant experience that makes you feel good, too.[12]Studies on the use of infrared sauna and exercise recovery are not consistent across the board. Other research found that well-trained runners who performed a simulated trail-running race recovered better and faster when they used cryotherapy (cold therapy)
    than with far-infrared or no therapy.[13]3. Infrared Sauna Therapy May Lower Stress LevelsThere’s no doubt that stepping into an infrared sauna feels good for most people. And for certain groups of people, it may also do more.A small study looked at mildly depressed people who were treated for 15 minutes once a day for five days in a far-infrared sauna and then told to lie in bed for 30 minutes.[14] Over
    four weeks they reported fewer physical complaints (such as discomfort and pain that’s viewed as mentally distressing), more relaxation, and an improvement in appetite compared with the control group. The authors theorized that thermal therapy
    is sedating (boosting relaxation) and may have an effect on the nervous system, triggering the “chill and calm” parasympathetic nervous system. A change in appetite is one symptom of depression,
 and this study also indicates that infrared sauna use may impact hunger hormones in a positive way.Another small study concluded that infrared sauna use among 38 obese individuals improved their quality of life (something that other research has shown is lower in folks with a higher BMI). In the study, participants sat in an infrared sauna for 15 minutes
    and rested in room-temperature air for 30 minutes twice a day for four consecutive days. After the four days, those taking infrared saunas reported less pain and discomfort in the short term as well as less anxiety and depression.[15]An infrared sauna is a warm, quiet space with nothing to distract you, which could also potentially be a factor in its therapeutic benefits, in addition to the actual infrared exposure. It can trigger your relaxation response to decrease stress, says
    Simms. One caveat, says Simms: You won’t get this benefit if you go in there and scroll social media or answer emails on your phone. As one review points out, sauna bathing might release endorphins,
 strongly support you to stop and practice mindfulness, reduce stress and improve relaxation, and can simply give you a break in your day for self-care that’s psychologically beneficial.[16] “People come out feeling really energized. An infrared sauna session can be invigorating,” says Simms.4. It May Help Decrease Discomfort in Inflammatory and Pain ConditionsA small amount of research has suggested that those with inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may benefit from infrared sauna therapy, which has been found to lessen
    pain and stiffness.One of these studies concluded that people with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis who used infrared therapy eight times over a four-week period had
    less pain, stiffness, and fatigue over the short term, though these differences were small.[17]In addition, one randomized controlled trial found that using a typical dry sauna for eight weeks helped people with chronic tension headaches reduce headache intensity by 44 percent.[18]
    The authors theorized that some of the effect could be from the relaxation response, which may decrease activity of the sympathetic nervous system, responsible for the fight-or-flight response. Another trial with 46 participants found that people
    with a chronic pain disorder had improvements in mood and were more likely to return to work after practicing infrared sauna bathing.[19]Finally, a pilot study evaluated 10 people with chronic fatigue syndrome who sat in a far-infrared sauna for 15 minutes and then lay in a bed under a blanket for 30 minutes once a day, five days a week for four weeks and found that the therapy helped
    reduce pain after treatment and improved mood.[20] The authors theorized that this therapy may have worked by reducing the oxidative stress that may play a role in symptoms (although
    they did not specifically test for this); the warmth was also likely relaxing, contributing to a boost in mood.A few things to keep in mind: Little research has been done on this topic over the past two decades, the number of participants in each study has been small, and the studies generally have lacked control groups. If you have an inflammatory or pain condition
    and are interested in infrared therapy, talk to your doctor about adding it to your treatment protocol.[16]"
"For the most part, infrared sauna therapy is safe.[4] The research and studies reviewed above mostly say that people who are in “generally good health” will be okay in the dry heat. Even those who have stable heart disease can likely go for a sauna bath, but it’s always a good idea to get the okay from your professional healthcare provider first. If you’ve had a recent heart attack, uncontrolled hypertension, or certain heart conditions, sauna bathing may be dangerous. (Again, talk to your doctor.)It is dangerous to consume alcohol in the sauna, however, as this can be taxing on your heart and can lead to accidental burns. In addition, other side effects tend to be mild and include feeling uncomfortable in the heat, light-headedness, and claustrophobia. You can always leave your session early if you do not feel well.In addition, infrared light and heat do not lie on the part of the light spectrum that contains UV rays, says Simms, so it will not damage your skin like a tanning bed would.[21] (Diagrams show the types of electromagnetic radiation and how they differ.)[22]People who are pregnant should avoid exposing their body to high temperatures and should therefore stay out of saunas.[23] If you are breastfeeding, check with your ob-gyn or professional healthcare provider first."
"Simms has some general guidance she gives those who’d like to try infrared sauna therapy. For specific guidance and balancing the risks and benefits, it’s best to discuss it with your primary health team.
1. Aim to Do Infrared Sauna Therapy Regularly
The benefits of infrared sauna don’t happen in a single session. (Research looked at multiple sessions done weekly over the course of several weeks or months.) One time will give you an indication of whether you like it, but going regularly and
    consistently is what’s needed for results, says Simms. She recommends scheduling two to three sessions per week for at least a month before assessing if you find it enjoyable and helpful to your health and wellness routine. 
2. Schedule It Before Exercise
Though this type of sauna therapy can deliver moderate results similar to exercise, it’s not the most effective form of physical activity, as it does not increase respiratory rates or improve heart function the way moderate-intensity exercise does,
    notes a small study on 10 women.[24] But infrared
    sauna use does literally warm your body. So one great use for infrared is as a warmup before a workout. “It’s like walking before a run,” Simms says.
3. Drink Up Before Infrared Sauna Therapy
Stay hydrated by drinking water or an electrolyte beverage before, during, and after your session, recommends Simms.
4. Consider Leaving Clothes Behind (if You’re Comfortable)
The idea is for the infrared light to penetrate your skin, so the more skin exposed the better, says Simms. If you feel comfortable, you can go fully unclothed and sit on a towel. If not, you’ll still get the benefits. Your comfort is most important
    (otherwise you might not want to go back).
5. Put Your Phone Away
If you’re one to check your email in any circumstance, including in an infrared sauna, leave your phone outside. Why? You may be able to get more of the stress-busting benefits of the therapy. Research shows that people who limit their email use
    have lower daily stress, which improves mood.[25] Instead of “making the most of your time,” try to sit quietly and breathe deeply, says Simms.
6. Try to Enjoy the Sweat
When you first start infrared sauna therapy, it might take a while for you to start sweating. After a few sessions, you will start to sweat more easily as your body becomes more acclimated to the heat, says Simms. (When the body is heat acclimated, it
    starts to sweat sooner and more profusely when heated, since sweat is a cooldown response.)"
"Infrared sauna therapy can be relaxing and help reduce stress, and it may deliver other benefits for your heart, exercise recovery, and reduced pain. “Infrared saunas are growing in popularity. While more research is needed, infrared sauna can be a useful part of a wellness strategy that includes exercise, good nutrition, stress management, and healthy sleep,” says Ring."

"Like many spices, turmeric (Curcuma longa) has a long history of use in traditional medicine. This flavor-filled spice is primarily cultivated from the rhizomes, or roots, of a flowering plant that grows in India and other parts of Southeast Asia, and aside from giving curry its vibrant yellow color, turmeric is also known for having potent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.[1]The primary active component of turmeric — and the one that gives the spice its characteristic yellow color — is curcumin.[1] Indeed, you can credit curcumin with most of turmeric’s potential health benefits."
"“Curcumin is a natural antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory benefits, as well as [possible] benefits related to slowing the aging process and preventing Alzheimer’s disease and, potentially, depression,” says Liz Shaw, RDN, the founder of Shaw Simple Swaps.Unfortunately, turmeric (and curcumin on its own) doesn’t absorb well into the bloodstream, and having it in curry once a month is unlikely to give you the desired anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits, says Dana White, RD, the owner of Dana White Nutrition. To reach the amounts of turmeric and curcumin shown to offer benefits in research studies, you’ll have to turn to supplements. It is important to note, however, that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has no established safe or recommended daily value for curcumin or turmeric, and the FDA does not regulate any supplements.Still, you may be able to reap more benefits by adding black pepper anytime you use turmeric, or taking a turmeric supplement that incorporates black pepper. “There is a compound in black pepper called piperine that actually helps to make turmeric more bioavailable,” White explains. “Bioavailability” refers to the amount of a substance that’s absorbed or able to be used by the body.[2] For instance, a past animal study found that 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) of piperine along with 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) of curcumin increased bioavailability by 2,000 percent.[3] Of course, further research is needed to determine if the results would be the same in humans. Here, we outline the many potential benefits of turmeric and curcumin.1. Curcumin Is an Anti-InflammatoryOne of turmeric’s main claims to fame is that it’s commonly used to fight inflammation, and the bulk of turmeric’s inflammation-fighting powers can be assigned to curcumin. In fact, in the right dose, curcumin may be a more effective anti-inflammatory treatment than common inflammation-fighting medications such as ibuprofen (Advil) and aspirin.[4] More research is needed in this area as well.Because chronic inflammation contributes to many chronic diseases, curcumin may help treat conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and arthritis.[5] We’ll get into some of those specific benefits later.[1]"
"2. Curcumin May Help Protect Against Heart Disease
A study shows that curcumin may improve endothelial function, or the health of the thin membrane that covers the inside of the heart and blood vessels. This membrane plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.[6] Lower endothelial function is associated with aging and an increased risk of heart disease. Thus, curcumin may help protect against age-related loss of function and reduce your likelihood of developing heart disease.
In one study, researchers compared the effects of an eight-week aerobic exercise    program and a curcumin supplement in improving endothelial function in post-menopausal women. Both the exercise and the curcumin group saw equal improvements in endothelial function, whereas the control group saw no changes.[7]
Another study[8] found that curcumin was equally effective at improving endothelial function in people with type 2 diabetes (heart disease is a common comorbidity of type 2 as the drug atorvastatin (Lipitor),[9] a medication commonly prescribed to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.[10]
Still, more research is needed to determine if curcumin is a safe and effective long-term treatment strategy for people with heart disease.
3. Curcumin May Help Prevent (and Possibly Treat) Certain Types of Cancer
As inflammation is linked to tumor growth, anti-inflammatory compounds such as curcumin may play a role in the treatment and prevention of a variety of cancer types, including colorectal,
    pancreatic, prostate, breast, and gastric cancers.[1] Research in mice suggests that curcumin may help slow the spread of tumor cells and may even prevent tumors from forming in the first place.[11] 
    It may do this in several ways, including disrupting the formation of cancerous cells at various stages in the cell cycle, interfering with cell signaling pathways, and even causing those cancerous cells to die.[11] Whether curcumin can help treat cancer in humans has yet to be determined, but the research is ongoing.
Some research also suggests that turmeric or curcumin can help with certain cancer symptoms. One review of 11 studies on the effects of turmeric on
    prostate diseases (including eight studies on patients with prostate cancer) suggests that supplementing with turmeric or curcumin may offer perks.[12] While some studies found curcumin or turmeric supplements had no effect on patients with prostate diseases, a few showed beneficial effects on levels of prostate-specific antigen (a protein produced by the prostate gland; blood levels of this protein are typically higher in men with prostate cancer), urination frequency and urgency, and quality of life.[13] Researchers note that more studies are needed to assess the true impact of curcumin on prostate conditions like cancer.[12]"
"4. Curcumin May Help Ease Symptoms of OsteoarthritisThanks to its potent anti-inflammatory properties, curcumin may be a safe and effective long-term treatment option for people with osteoarthritis (OA). At least, that was the conclusion of the authors of a  review of the clinical use of curcumin for the treatment of osteoarthritis.[14]In a past study,[15] people with osteoarthritis who took 1,000 mg per day of Meriva experienced significant improvements in stiffness and physical function after eight months, whereas the control group saw no improvements. Meriva is a proprietary treatment made up of a natural curcuminoid mixture (75 percent curcumin, 15 percent demethoxycurcumin, and 10 percent bisdemethoxycurcumin), phosphatidylcholine (a chemical found in eggs, soybeans, and other foods),[16] and microcrystalline cellulose (a refined wood pulp commonly used by the pharmaceutical and food industries).[17]Meanwhile, a recent clinical trial studied the potential effects of curcumin supplements on patients with knee osteoarthritis. The group that took 40 mg of nanocurcumin in a capsule every 12 hours experienced a significant decrease in pain and stiffness after six weeks compared with the control group.[18]And a study in mice  found that 50 mg oral curcumin per kg of body weight significantly slowed the progression of OA, whereas a topical curcumin treatment provided pain relief.[19] That said, whether these specific benefits apply to humans has yet to be seen.  5. Curcumin May Help Treat or Prevent DiabetesAccording to a past review of studies,[20] curcumin may help treat and prevent diabetes, as well as associated disorders like diabetic nephropathy (also called diabetic kidney disease), which affects people with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes.[21] One drawback: Many of the studies were done only in animals, not humans.For example, one study found that feeding 80 mg of tetrahydrocurcumin (one of the main substances in curcumin) per kg of body weight to rats with type 2 diabetes for 45 days led to a significant decrease in blood sugar, as well as an increase in plasma insulin.[22]A study of obese mice with type 2 diabetes  revealed that curcumin supplements helped lower blood insulin levels after 16 weeks.[23]The authors of a recent review note that curcumin may be a good adjunct to diabetes treatment to improve insulin resistance and blood sugar control, and lower blood lipids (fatty substances found in the blood).[24]Meanwhile, curcumin may help prevent diabetes through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and improve many of the factors that contribute to diabetes, including insulin resistance, high blood sugar, and hyperlipidemia (a medical term to describe elevated levels of fat in the blood; one type of hyperlipidemia is characterized by high levels of LDL or “bad” cholesterol).[25] Still, more human studies are needed to confirm.[20]"
"6. Curcumin May Help Delay or Reverse Alzheimer’s DiseaseTurmeric may even help protect your brain against common degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. How? By increasing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein found in the brain and spinal cord that plays a key role in keeping nerve cells (neurons) healthy, as well as regulating communication between nerve cells, which is critical for learning and memory.[26] As common brain disorders like Alzheimer’s are associated with lower levels of BDNF, turmeric (curcumin in particular) may help delay or reverse brain degeneration.[27]That said, much of the research has been done in rats.[28] Researchers note more research is needed to confirm the effectiveness of turmeric in the prevention and treatment of common brain diseases.[29]7. Curcumin May Play a Role in Depression TreatmentLike Alzheimer’s, depression is associated with lower levels of BDNF. Thanks to turmeric’s ability to boost levels of BDNF, the spice shows promise as an effective antidepressant. In fact, one study found that rats injected with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg of curcumin for 10 days had a dose-dependent increase in BDNF, with the higher dose of 200 mg/kg showing greater antidepressant effects.[30]Meanwhile, in a study in humans, researchers randomly assigned 60 patients with major depressive disorder to one of three groups: One group received daily 20 mg of fluoxetine (Prozac is a common brand name),[31] another received 1,000 mg of curcumin, and a third received a combination of the two. By the end of six weeks, the three groups saw comparable improvements, leading researchers to suggest that curcumin may be a safe and effective treatment for major depressive disorder.[32]Still, scientists don’t fully understand the role of turmeric and curcumin in treating depression, and more research in humans is needed to confirm it is a safe and effective treatment. You should consult your primary care practitioner before beginning or changing any medications you may be taking.[33]"
"8. Curcumin May Play a Role in Treating Rheumatoid ArthritisCurcumin shows promise as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder that commonly affects the joints but may spread to other areas, such as the eyes, lungs, skin, heart, and blood vessels.[34] RA causes a painful swelling of the joints that can cause the bones to erode over time and ultimately lead to deformities and physical disabilities.[34]In one study, people with RA were given 500 mg of curcumin, 50 mg of diclofenac sodium (a prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), or the two in combination.[35] After eight weeks, the curcumin-only group saw significant improvements in joint tenderness and swelling when compared with the other two groups. Researchers note the curcumin treatment was also safe, resulting in no harmful events.[36]9. Turmeric May Improve Skin HealthThanks to its anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, turmeric may be an effective treatment for a variety of skin conditions, including acne, eczema (atopic dermatitis), photoaging, and psoriasis. Yet robust research is lacking.One review  suggests oral curcumin in particular may be an effective and safe treatment option for psoriasis (a chronic inflammatory skin disease), but more studies are needed before doctors make recommendations.[37]According to the authors of another review, topical curcumin treatments may be useful in treating skin disorders, especially as past research suggests curcumin is relatively safe even at high doses. But curcumin’s bright yellow-orange color, poor solubility, and poor stability at a high pH make it an unappealing topical skin treatment.[38]And thanks to its poor bioavailability, chances are you’d have to use curcumin to complement, not replace, other skin treatments, according to the authors of one study.[39]"
"10. Turmeric Protects Your Body From Free RadicalsAntioxidants help protect your body against damage caused by free radicals, a class of highly reactive atoms that are generated in our bodies and found in environmental pollutants like cigarette smoke and industrial chemicals.[40] Too much exposure to free radicals can mess with the fats, proteins, and even DNA in your body, which may lead to a number of common diseases and health conditions, including cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s.[40] Therefore, antioxidant-rich spices like turmeric may play a role in protecting you from free radical damage.Curcumin in particular is able to scavenge different types of free radicals, control enzymes that neutralize free radicals, and prevent certain enzymes from creating specific free radical types, according to a review.[41]11. Turmeric May Work as an Anti-Aging SupplementCurrently, there’s no evidence that turmeric or curcumin directly influence longevity, but thanks to their ability to fight inflammation, protect your body against free radicals, and potentially delay brain degeneration and other age-related diseases, turmeric and curcumin may be effective anti-aging supplements, according to past research.[42]Studies also suggest that turmeric and curcumin are mostly safe, although some negative side effects (diarrhea, headache, rash) have been reported at doses ranging from 500 to 12,000 mg.[41]12. Curcumin May Prevent Eye DegenerationGlaucoma, a group of eye conditions, is one of the leading causes of blindness in people over age 60.[43] And, unfortunately, once your vision is gone, it can’t be restored.[43]But preliminary research  shows topical curcumin treatments may help protect the eyes against degeneration. Researchers applied a proprietary curcumin eye drop solution to rats two times per day for three weeks. By the end of the study, the untreated rats experienced a 23 percent reduction in retinal cells compared with the treatment group, suggesting that loss was prevented by the curcumin treatment.[44] The study findings sound impressive, but more studies are needed to determine if curcumin is effective in preventing eye degeneration in humans."
