when you re struggling with endometriosis symptoms like pelvic pain cramping and excessive bleeding going for a run or rolling out the mat for a yoga session might seem pretty unappealing however working out can actually improve symptoms for some women who have endometriosis helping them feel better both mentally and physically while there isn t a lot of research on exercise s impact on endometriosis some of the results are promising a 2019 study found that rats with endometriosis that did moderate and intense exercise had a decrease in the size of endometriotic lesions exercise in endometriosis is not well studied but if a patient tells me that when she works out she feels better i say go do it says sanjay agarwal md a professor of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the university of california at san diego it s good for you for many reasons so go exercise the benefits of exercising with endometriosishere s how a commitment to fitness might help you soothe some of the symptoms of endometriosis 1 exercise can boost your mood you ve heard of runner s high right when you work out your brain produces natural endorphins that can boost your mood says hugh taylor md the chair of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the yale school of medicine in new haven connecticut exercise is not a cure for endometriosis but it can certainly help with some of the pain and mood changes that are associated with it the mood boosting effect of exercise is especially important because depression and anxiety sometimes occur along with endometriosis there s naturally a higher incidence of depression and anxiety in people with endometriosis that we believe is actually caused by the endometriosis says dr taylor his research in animal models published 2018 suggests a direct link between endometriosis and these mental health disorders more recently a 2023 review also showed an association between endometriosis depression anxiety depression and eating disorders for the maximum effect of exercise on your mood break a sweat the more vigorous the exercise taylor says the better the endorphin production plus it s always good for your health so i generally recommend to any of my patients that some fairly vigorous exercise is a good idea for all of us 2 exercise can help relieve pain i think there are many reasons that exercise can be part of a multipronged strategy to treat endometriosis pain says dr agarwal first when you work out you loosen a variety of ligaments and muscles which allows you to move better in spite of your pain what s more agarwal says exercise can prompt the release of natural opioids like substances that can help you manage pain another benefit is that when you exercise you can focus on the workout itself instead of your pain when it comes to research on how exercise affects endometriosis pain or chronic pain due to other conditions the results are mixed a 2021 review found that while some studies showed a beneficial effect of exercise on endometriosis pain others showed no effect or a negative effect a 2017 review on exercise and chronic pain called for more research on the subject since most studies had small sample sizes
