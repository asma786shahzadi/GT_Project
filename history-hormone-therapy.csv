the history of menopausal hormone therapy for women began with two men one discovered estrogen the predominant female sex hormone the other convinced women that if you were past menopause and didn t replace this hormone you weren t truly female ever since hormone therapy has had its ups and downs creating confusion for women seeking relief from hot flashes or vaginal dryness which is a shame says stephanie faubion md the director of the center for women s health at mayo clinic and the medical director of the north american menopause society nams because the science is clear that for most women the benefits of menopausal hormone therapy ht for symptom relief outweigh any risks how did we get all the misperceptions about hormone therapy that still muddle decision making about ht read on to learn about its wild history related birth control and contraception options an a to z guide
estrogen was discovered in st louis in 1929before you can have hormone therapy you have to have hormones credit for discovering the various forms of estrogen goes to the scientist edward adelbert doisy in the early 20th century doisy and his colleagues developed analytical techniques for measuring various substances in the blood and urine according to an article in the journal of biological chemistry when doisy changed jobs in 1923 to head up the new biochemistry department at the st louis university medical school he began finding substances to measure through this process of analyzing the urine and follicular fluids of pigs doisy eventually isolated the female sex hormone estrogen there are three types of estrogens that dominate in different phases of a woman s life for women between their first menstruation and menopause estradiol is the most common estriol dominates during pregnancy after menopause the primary estrogen a woman makes is estrone notes the cleveland clinic 
synthetic hormones first used for menstrual crampsonce estrogen was discovered it was only a matter of time before scientists figured out how to turn it into a drug the first commercial preparation of estrogen was called emmenin it was an alcohol soluble substance derived from extracts of human placentas a paper published in 1935 in the canadian medical association journal described this oral solution s value for treating painful menstrual cramps which go by the medical name dysmenorrhea related 10 ways to relieve period cramps
manufacturing and mass producing synthetic estrogeneventually scientists found they could manufacture estrogen rather than take it from the placenta by collecting substances from the urine of pregnant mares when commercial production got going the drug was named premarin after pregnant mares urine premarin was dominated by estrone but it contained other estrogen types as well according to the menopause blog at the university of rochester medical center in 1942 premarin was approved by the u s food and drug administration fda for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes according to an article in the american journal of medicine interestingly this happened nearly two decades before the first hormonal birth control pill was approved in 1960 related birth control in america a brief history of contraceptionaccording to a history of estrogen therapy published in sexual medicine reviews in july 2019 books and publications throughout the 1950s promoted the use of estrogen therapy which eventually tripled in use by the mid 1970s 
the book that made hormone therapy famouswithout estrogen can you still be feminine it may sound like a crazy question today but a book published in 1966 feminine forever had women asking themselves if they could robert a wilson wrote that taking estrogen would allow a woman to remain feminine forever and if she didn t do so she would not wilson claimed that menopause was a preventable event because women could simply add back the estrogen their body was no longer making by taking hormone pills with this therapy a woman s breasts and genital organs will not shrivel she will be much more pleasant to live with and will not become dull and unattractive the book claimed per nbc news feminine forever became a bestseller causing women who read it to flock to their gynecologists in droves 
demand for hormone therapy increasesbecause some research in the 1970s showed that estrogen medication was linked to an increase in a woman s risk of endometrial cancer cancer of the lining of the uterus women who still had their uterus were given a combined hormone treatment of both estrogen and synthetic progesterone called progestin which would protect her from this problem according to the article in sexual medicine reviews estrogen use increased through the 1980s and 1990s among all women with a corresponding increase in the use of progestin by women with a uterus these treatments were initially referred to as hormone replacement therapy hrt or sometimes as medlineplus explains estrogen replacement therapy ert or menopausal hormone therapy but this was later changed to hormone therapy ht related cancer risks signs symptoms tests treatments and more
another book casts doubt on hormone therapyas women turned ht into a blockbuster drug some women s health advocates remained concerned that menopausal women were unknowingly taking part in a vast experiment since no large scale research had proved these drugs were safe and effective an advocate named barbara seaman finally got people talking about the risks when her 1977 book women and the crisis in sex hormones vaulted to the bestseller list seaman warned of small studies linking ht to breast cancer strokes and blood clots but if the book caused some women to question ht its effect was short lived observational studies in the 1980s and 1990s began touting another benefit of the drugs the prospect that they could protect women from the dangers of deadly heart disease one such study was the famous nurses health study which followed nearly 60 000 women through menopause in a report published in 1996 in the new england journal of medicine researchers concluded we observed a marked decrease in the risk of major coronary heart disease among women who took estrogen with progestin related your definitive guide to heart diseasea marketing frenzy made ht a bestsellerwith so much money to be made from ht drug companies promoted it extensively to women and gynecologists during the last decades of the 20th century especially touting its protection for the heart their marketing efforts worked by 1992 premarin was the no 1 prescribed drug in the united states by 1997 its sales exceeded 1 billion according to the menopause blog 
forever young anti aging momentum beginsan article on the history of hormone therapy published in september 2019 in the journal medicina notes that around that time numerous observational studies suggested that hrt had various benefits not only with regard to the treatment of menopausal symptoms but also in the prevention of chronic diseases thus the idea switched from feminine forever to healthy forever women too sang the pill s praises for its potentially wide effects gloria bachmann md a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at rutgers robert wood johnson medical school in new brunswick new jersey wrote in the international journal of fertility and menopausal studies in 1995 that ht improved the look of the skin breast and muscles among other things and therefore plays an important role in boosting a woman s self image and self esteem a call for more scientific research on hormone therapyeven as they prescribed it though doctors were eager for better clinical trials they wanted large studies randomizing women to take a pill which they wouldn t know was ht or a placebo rather than the observational studies many had been relying on 
the heart and estrogen progestin replacement study hers looked at women taking htthey got their first wish with the heart and estrogen progestin replacement study hers a study of some 3 000 older women with cardiovascular disease who were given either ht or a placebo this randomized controlled trial challenged the theory that ht was beneficial for heart disease the women were followed for an average of four years results of the hers research appeared in an article published in 1998 in the journal of the american medical association jama if hormone advocates had hoped this research would prove the drug protected the heart they were disappointed hers found no benefit of the top selling ht formulation to prevent cardiovascular events women who had taken ht did not have fewer heart attacks than those who didn t take the pills 
new concerns over ht risks for blood clots other diseaseeven more concerning the treatment was found to increase the risk of blood clots and gallbladder disease the researchers concluded in their jama report that they do not recommend starting this treatment for the purpose of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease although they did say that because blood clots primarily occurred early in the treatment cycle women who had been on ht for years who didn t have a problem could safely continue related what is the gallbladder and what does it do the hers trial severely rocked the boat of hormone therapy said david katz md the president of the nonprofit true health initiative in an article in huffington post ht had previously been a placid sea of prevailing conviction with only small waves of misgivings he writes those waves were now much more intense 
the women s health initiative whi launchesthe women s health initiative whi was the first national randomized clinical trial to track hormone therapy in healthy post menopausal women separately the study also examined other issues in this population including whether vitamin d supplements or low fat diets are beneficial according to an article in the journal controlled clinical trials this study which began enrolling women in 1992 planned to track women until 2005 comparing the health effects of those who took combined estrogen progestin ht or for women without a uterus estrogen only therapy with women taking a placebo related 10 things your doctor won t tell you about hysterectomysome 160 000 women across the united states were ultimately enrolled in all phases of the study the women ranged in age from 50 to 79 meaning most were well past the time of menopause early findings from the whi couldn t be ignoredin 2002 the whi shocked the medical community by announcing in an article in jama that after following the women for a mean of five years it had pulled the plug on the estrogen plus progestin arm earlier than expected because the health risks of the trial exceeded the health benefits new concerns about ht and breast cancer and heart disease halt whi researchthe researchers had discovered that for each 10 000 person years women on these pills would experience eight extra cases of invasive breast cancer seven additional cardiac events eight more strokes and eight additional pulmonary embolisms but they also noted that there would be six fewer colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures two years later the estrogen only study was also stopped ahead of time because it also uncovered an increased risk of blood clots for these women though there was no significant increase in breast cancer risk noted the national institutes of health related breast cancer signs symptoms latest treatments tests and more
whi delivered a treasure trove of health informationwhi researchers continued following the women even after they stopped their pills the huge database of the whi has been analyzed extensively over the years and reported on in more than a hundred different publications these more comprehensive analyses have brought more nuance to the initial belief that taking ht for vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes is a risky endeavor breast cancer taking estrogen alone which only women who have had a hysterectomy can safely do actually decreases breast cancer risks taking combined hormone therapy though does raise risk substantially and cancers may be more aggressive because they are diagnosed at a more advanced stage heart disease estrogen alone does not increase risk of heart disease and in women in their fifties the age when most would take it to deal with hot flashes it actually decreases it in women taking combined ht the biggest risk for heart disease happens the first year after starting the drugs although a small increased risk continues through the entire treatment hip fracture taking estrogen either in combination or alone is actually good for these bones as it decreases hip fracture risk by a third during the treatment years with some benefits continuing after the pills are stopped according to an updated overview of whi study results published in jama colorectal cancer on combined ht pills colorectal cancer risk decreases estrogen alone has no effect stroke and blood clots stroke risk increases by one third during treatment for both groups as does the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs according to the study in jama other conditions importantly the hot flashes and night sweats that are the bane of many women in the menopause transition decreases in women in their early fifties who take ht memory is not affected in this age group although women over 65 seem to increase their risk of dementia diabetes rates go down in women on ht but gallbladder disease and urinary incontinence become more prevalent criticisms of the whi research approach surfaceone of the criticisms of the whi is that a majority of the study participants were more than a decade beyond the menopause transition and as an article in fertility and sterility notes were because of their age predisposed to coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis hormone therapy that is started earlier the article adds promises a more favorable risk benefit outcome clarifying what ht is and is not indicated foraccording to dr faubion the medical director of nams all these studies point to the same conclusion women should not take ht for the purpose of preventing heart disease or stroke instead the three indications for use of menopausal hormone therapy are vasomotor symptoms genitourinary syndrome of menopause such as vaginal dryness painful urination or painful sex and prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture risk most women suffering from hot flashes can safely take ht according to all the research faubion says if a woman is under 60 and within 10 years of menopause onset the benefits of hormone therapy tend to outweigh the risks the dose and formulation of the therapy pills or patches for example should be individualized for each woman to make the treatment safer and all this needs to be assessed on a regular basis i have my patients return once a year or sooner if any symptoms change or if anything s new about their personal or family history she says 
what about other hormone formulas and delivery methods another charge against the whi study researchers that they only tested premarin the synthetic estrogen made from the pregnant mare urine and prempro the combination of premarin and the progestin provera these were the commonly used ht when the trial started as a result notes the article in the journal medicina the whi findings did not answer doubts about the safety and effectiveness of other hrt formulations regimens and delivery methods for example the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog notes that forms of therapy not taken by mouth such as skin patches sprays rings and others may have less risk of causing deep vein thrombosis than those taken by mouth 
are bioidentical hormones any better questions raised after the 2002 whi results caused some doctors and women to advocate for bioidentical hormones those made from plant sources sometimes called human identical hormones one early voice for bioidenticals was the actress suzanne somers whose 2004 book the sexy years claimed that natural bioidentical hormones were the secret to somers s youthfulness or as the subtitle says fabulous sex great health and vitality some doctors believe women fare better when they use bioidentical hormones felice gersh md a gynecologist and integrative medicine physician in irvine california who is on the consultative faculty at the university of arizona college of medicine in tucson says these hormones are closer to what is naturally found in the body pharmaceutical hormones can bind to human hormone receptor sites but absolutely do not have the same effects as do natural or human identical hormones she says in an editorial in the journal heart published online in february 2020 dr gersh advocated for most women in the menopause transition to be offered bioidentical hormones delivered transdermally through the skin typically via a patch or gel along with micronized progesterone as a way to protect the heart while aiding menopausal symptoms this should especially be the case for women who enter menopause early the editorial states because their risk of dying of heart disease is higher than other women s acog cautions that some bioidenticals are compounded in local pharmacies rather than in larger factories compounding pharmacies must be licensed but they do not have to show the safety effectiveness and quality control that the fda requires of drugmakers that s why acog recommends fda approved hormone therapy over compounded hormone therapy related healthy sex the ultimate guide
hormone therapy and midlife women todayaccording to the north american menopause society ht is still the most effective treatment for the hot flashes and vaginal dryness that come with menopause because of the risks women wanting relief from these symptoms should work with their doctors to individualize a treatment plan for women younger than 60 or those who went through the menopause transition less than 10 years ago and have no contraindications the benefit to risk ratio may make ht worthwhile nams states the case is less clear for older women or those further from the change for them the benefit risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease stroke venous thromboembolism and dementia the society says although this doesn t mean they should never go on ht related dementia causes symptoms treatment and moremoving away from touting hormones as a panacea and recognizing what they do bestwomen discovered it as early as the 1940s but had to wait decades for scientific proof hormone therapy can be extremely beneficial when it comes to treating hot flashes but it s not without its problems which occurred when women were told they could take hormones for decades as a way to stay young or stave off cardiovascular and other diseases that increase with aging that has certainly proven not to be a safe or effective strategy every woman considering ht should talk with her doctor about her menopausal symptoms and her personal and family health and disease history to determine whether the treatment is right for them
