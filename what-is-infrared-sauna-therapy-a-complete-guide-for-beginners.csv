gwyneth paltrow has done it 1 cindy crawford has too 2 same for selena gomez and emma roberts 3 it turns out one of the hottest wellness therapies among celebrities is literally hot well more like pleasantly warm the first thing you ll notice when stepping into an infrared sauna is that it s not that hot at least not as piping as a traditional dry heat sauna which ranges in temperature from 150 to 195 degrees f and heats the surrounding air in order to heat your body infrared saunas use light to create heat generating warmth and triggering several possible health benefits 4 infrared saunas average about 110 to 120 degrees f upon entry says kelly simms nd a doctor of naturopathic medicine in wilmette illinois there are different types of infrared light determined by their wavelength which are not in the visible light spectrum the wavelength determines the depth of penetration through the skin she says far infrared reaches the greatest depths within the body near and medium rays penetrate to a shallower degree the result your body slowly heats up in an infrared sauna and you may not start sweating until the end of the session which may last from 30 to 40 minutes or more she explains depending on the type of sauna that you re in it typically works up to a temperature of 140 to 145 degrees f 
the use of saunas for healing and wellness is nothing new sauna therapy has been used for centuries for relaxation and health promotion says dr simms whole body thermal therapy has been used for thousands of years in healing and as part of cultural and spiritual traditions such as the native american sweat lodge the turkish hammam and the russian banya this type of wellness therapy has a long history in finnish culture too where today most residents bathe in the sauna at least weekly and where most new homes in the country are built with saunas in them 5 in 1965 the first ceramic infrared sauna using far infrared wavelengths was patented in japan and the therapeutic devices were mostly used by medical practitioners there until infrared saunas made their debut in the united states in the 1980s 6 
so what exactly is an infrared sauna and how does the therapy work there are several different types far infrared therapythis type of infrared therapy incorporates the far infrared wavelengths which deeply penetrate the skin infrared lights do not have a color because they are not visible light far infrared therapy is also called dry sauna bathing the benefits described in this story are documented in research on far infrared sauna bathing near infrared therapyalso called photobiomodulation therapy or pbmt this type of infrared therapy uses near infrared wavelengths to promote healing this therapy uses sources in the visible light and near infrared spectrum to regenerate tissue improve wound healing and circulation and lessen pain and inflammation 7 pbmt may be administered via wearable units that are localized to the affected area rather than a full body walk in sauna full spectrum infrared therapythis type of infrared therapy incorporates all ranges of infrared wavelengths chromotherapythis type of therapy adds colored lights to an infrared sauna with the idea that certain colors provoke different body responses and benefits what s the difference between red light therapy and infrared sauna therapy infrared and red light are not the same thing red light therapy is a different type of therapy that uses low wavelength light led to treat sun damaged skin scarring and wound healing psoriasis rosacea and eczema 8 while this can be done in a doctor s office you can also purchase red light therapy devices to use at home such as to support healthy skin aging infrared heat is not associated with a specific light color says simms but many people also use chromotherapy or colored lights for additional health benefits these lights lie on the visible spectrum red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet and are all different wavelengths which is said to treat medical conditions 9 if chromotherapy is used in an infrared sauna session it s for an added benefit 
 infrared saunas have been studied for a variety of problems such as cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic pain syndromes and injuries says melinda ring md director of the osher center for integrative health at northwestern university in chicago it s important to keep in mind that research on infrared therapy is limited and more is needed to explore exactly what benefits it may provide she explains what s more much of the existing body of literature on the health benefits of sauna bathing is on traditional finnish saunas and is not specific to infrared therapy while some studies speak to infrared sauna bathing specifically they are as a whole based on small groups of people here s a look at what more recent research suggests infrared sauna may be able to do for your health 1 infrared sauna therapy may support heart health in certain populationsa meta analysis of nine studies on patients with heart failure concluded that taking an infrared sauna for 15 minutes five times a week for two to four weeks improved certain heart biomarkers and measures of heart function in the short term 10 another research review explains the potential connection between saunas and heart health 11 the authors concluded that sauna bathing including infrared sauna use may reduce blood pressure improve blood vessel function reduce inflammation and calm the nervous system among other changes what s more the heart s reaction to sauna bathing may also be akin to walking something that strengthens the heart and is recommended for people who have heart failure 2 it may be useful to boost exercise benefitsan infrared sauna session may stimulate a physiological response similar to exercise that said it is not a substitute for exercise rather a short infrared sauna session before a workout can serve as a nice way to warm up your muscles says simms post exercise it may also offer some benefits a small study on 10 men found that using a far infrared sauna for 30 minutes after a strenuous hour long strength training workout helped improve neuromuscular recovery this may be because infrared heat penetrates muscles deeper to help relax leg muscles better than room temperature air plus as the study points out it s a pleasant experience that makes you feel good too 12 studies on the use of infrared sauna and exercise recovery are not consistent across the board other research found that well trained runners who performed a simulated trail running race recovered better and faster when they used cryotherapy cold therapy than with far infrared or no therapy 13 3 infrared sauna therapy may lower stress levelsthere s no doubt that stepping into an infrared sauna feels good for most people and for certain groups of people it may also do more a small study looked at mildly depressed people who were treated for 15 minutes once a day for five days in a far infrared sauna and then told to lie in bed for 30 minutes 14 over four weeks they reported fewer physical complaints such as discomfort and pain that s viewed as mentally distressing more relaxation and an improvement in appetite compared with the control group the authors theorized that thermal therapy is sedating boosting relaxation and may have an effect on the nervous system triggering the chill and calm parasympathetic nervous system a change in appetite is one symptom of depression and this study also indicates that infrared sauna use may impact hunger hormones in a positive way another small study concluded that infrared sauna use among 38 obese individuals improved their quality of life something that other research has shown is lower in folks with a higher bmi in the study participants sat in an infrared sauna for 15 minutes and rested in room temperature air for 30 minutes twice a day for four consecutive days after the four days those taking infrared saunas reported less pain and discomfort in the short term as well as less anxiety and depression 15 an infrared sauna is a warm quiet space with nothing to distract you which could also potentially be a factor in its therapeutic benefits in addition to the actual infrared exposure it can trigger your relaxation response to decrease stress says simms one caveat says simms you won t get this benefit if you go in there and scroll social media or answer emails on your phone as one review points out sauna bathing might release endorphins strongly support you to stop and practice mindfulness reduce stress and improve relaxation and can simply give you a break in your day for self care that s psychologically beneficial 16 people come out feeling really energized an infrared sauna session can be invigorating says simms 4 it may help decrease discomfort in inflammatory and pain conditionsa small amount of research has suggested that those with inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis may benefit from infrared sauna therapy which has been found to lessen pain and stiffness one of these studies concluded that people with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis who used infrared therapy eight times over a four week period had less pain stiffness and fatigue over the short term though these differences were small 17 in addition one randomized controlled trial found that using a typical dry sauna for eight weeks helped people with chronic tension headaches reduce headache intensity by 44 percent 18 the authors theorized that some of the effect could be from the relaxation response which may decrease activity of the sympathetic nervous system responsible for the fight or flight response another trial with 46 participants found that people with a chronic pain disorder had improvements in mood and were more likely to return to work after practicing infrared sauna bathing 19 finally a pilot study evaluated 10 people with chronic fatigue syndrome who sat in a far infrared sauna for 15 minutes and then lay in a bed under a blanket for 30 minutes once a day five days a week for four weeks and found that the therapy helped reduce pain after treatment and improved mood 20 the authors theorized that this therapy may have worked by reducing the oxidative stress that may play a role in symptoms although they did not specifically test for this the warmth was also likely relaxing contributing to a boost in mood a few things to keep in mind little research has been done on this topic over the past two decades the number of participants in each study has been small and the studies generally have lacked control groups if you have an inflammatory or pain condition and are interested in infrared therapy talk to your doctor about adding it to your treatment protocol 16 
for the most part infrared sauna therapy is safe 4 the research and studies reviewed above mostly say that people who are in generally good health will be okay in the dry heat even those who have stable heart disease can likely go for a sauna bath but it s always a good idea to get the okay from your professional healthcare provider first if you ve had a recent heart attack uncontrolled hypertension or certain heart conditions sauna bathing may be dangerous again talk to your doctor it is dangerous to consume alcohol in the sauna however as this can be taxing on your heart and can lead to accidental burns in addition other side effects tend to be mild and include feeling uncomfortable in the heat light headedness and claustrophobia you can always leave your session early if you do not feel well in addition infrared light and heat do not lie on the part of the light spectrum that contains uv rays says simms so it will not damage your skin like a tanning bed would 21 diagrams show the types of electromagnetic radiation and how they differ 22 people who are pregnant should avoid exposing their body to high temperatures and should therefore stay out of saunas 23 if you are breastfeeding check with your ob gyn or professional healthcare provider first 
simms has some general guidance she gives those who d like to try infrared sauna therapy for specific guidance and balancing the risks and benefits it s best to discuss it with your primary health team 1 aim to do infrared sauna therapy regularly the benefits of infrared sauna don t happen in a single session research looked at multiple sessions done weekly over the course of several weeks or months one time will give you an indication of whether you like it but going regularly and consistently is what s needed for results says simms she recommends scheduling two to three sessions per week for at least a month before assessing if you find it enjoyable and helpful to your health and wellness routine 2 schedule it before exercise though this type of sauna therapy can deliver moderate results similar to exercise it s not the most effective form of physical activity as it does not increase respiratory rates or improve heart function the way moderate intensity exercise does notes a small study on 10 women 24 but infrared sauna use does literally warm your body so one great use for infrared is as a warmup before a workout it s like walking before a run simms says 3 drink up before infrared sauna therapy stay hydrated by drinking water or an electrolyte beverage before during and after your session recommends simms 4 consider leaving clothes behind if you re comfortable the idea is for the infrared light to penetrate your skin so the more skin exposed the better says simms if you feel comfortable you can go fully unclothed and sit on a towel if not you ll still get the benefits your comfort is most important otherwise you might not want to go back 5 put your phone away if you re one to check your email in any circumstance including in an infrared sauna leave your phone outside why you may be able to get more of the stress busting benefits of the therapy research shows that people who limit their email use have lower daily stress which improves mood 25 instead of making the most of your time try to sit quietly and breathe deeply says simms 6 try to enjoy the sweat when you first start infrared sauna therapy it might take a while for you to start sweating after a few sessions you will start to sweat more easily as your body becomes more acclimated to the heat says simms when the body is heat acclimated it starts to sweat sooner and more profusely when heated since sweat is a cooldown response 
infrared sauna therapy can be relaxing and help reduce stress and it may deliver other benefits for your heart exercise recovery and reduced pain infrared saunas are growing in popularity while more research is needed infrared sauna can be a useful part of a wellness strategy that includes exercise good nutrition stress management and healthy sleep says ring
